        "summary": "This survey presents an overview of CNN architectures for human action recognition and human pose estimation from videos. The paper traces the development and adaptations of the subset of networks that have been extended for animal behavior classification. Action recognition aims to identify and classify the activity in a trimmed video. The output of an action recognition algorithm is a set of class labels for each trimmed video. When the class label is one of a set of pre-de\ufb01ned expressions that occur in response to a stimuli (behavior) [32], the task is behavior classification. Pose estimation is the task of determining a subject\u2019s position and orientation in an image frame. Pose-based action recognition methods use pose estimation predictions (image frame coordinates) to classify body movements. Pose estimation may be used to identify joint positions before classifying behavior.",
        "abstract": "Classifying the behavior of humans or animals from videos is important in biomedical fields for understanding brain function and response to stimuli. Action recognition, classifying activities performed by one or more subjects in a trimmed video, forms the basis of many of these techniques. Deep learning models for human action recognition have progressed significantly over the last decade. Recently, there is an increased interest in research that incorporates deep learning-based action recognition for animal behavior classification. However, human action recognition methods are more developed. This survey presents an overview of human action recognition and pose estimation methods that are based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and have been adapted for animal behavior classification in neuroscience. Pose estimation, estimating joint positions from an image frame, is included because it is often applied before classifying animal behavior. First, we provide foundational information on algorithms that learn spatiotemporal features through 2D, two-stream, and 3D CNNs. We explore motivating factors that determine optimizers, loss functions and training procedures, and compare their performance on benchmark datasets. Next, we review animal behavior frameworks that use or build upon these methods, organized by the level of supervision they require. Our discussion is uniquely focused on the technical evolution of the underlying CNN models and their architectural adaptations (which we illustrate), rather than their usability in a neuroscience lab. We conclude by discussing open research problems, and possible research directions. Our survey is designed to be a resource for researchers developing fully unsupervised animal behavior classification systems of which there are only a few examples in the literature.",

        "2_additional_depth_q:follow up question": "How do CNNs use action recognition and pose estimation techniques to classify animal behavior?",
        "2_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "CNNs use their ability to identify patterns in images and videos to classify animal behavior. They can learn to recognize specific movements and postures, and then use this knowledge to identify the behavior of an animal. For example, a CNN could learn to recognize the movement of a cat jumping, and then use this knowledge to identify the cat as jumping in a video.",
        "2_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "CNNs use a variety of techniques to perform action recognition and pose estimation, which can then be used to classify animal behavior. These techniques include:\n\n* **Spatial convolutions:** CNNs use spatial convolutions to identify patterns in images and videos. These convolutions are performed by applying a filter to the input data, and then summing the results. The filter is typically a small matrix of weights, and it is applied to the input data at every possible location. The output of the convolution is a new matrix of values, which represents the patterns that were detected by the filter.\n\n* **Pooling:** Pooling is a technique that is used to reduce the dimensionality of the output of a convolution. Pooling is performed by dividing the output of the convolution into a grid of cells, and then taking the maximum or average value from each cell. This reduces the number of values that need to be processed by the network, and it also helps to make the network more robust to noise.\n\n* **Fully connected layers:** Fully connected layers are used to combine the output of the convolutional and pooling layers into a single vector. This vector is then used to classify the input data.\n\nCNNs have been shown to be very effective for action recognition and pose estimation. They are able to learn complex patterns in data, and they are robust to noise and variations in the input data. This makes them well-suited for classifying animal behavior, which can be a challenging task due to the variability of animal movements and postures.",

Pose estimation is the ability to estimate the position and orientation of a human body's joints in an image or video frame, like the position of the head, shoulders, elbows, and knees. Action recognition and pose estimation are related because body pose can provide valuable information for recognizing actions. For example, if you see a person's hand moving up and down, you can infer that they are waving.",
        "3_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "Human action recognition and pose estimation are two closely related tasks in computer vision. Action recognition aims to identify and classify the activity performed by one or more subjects in a video, while pose estimation focuses on estimating the position and orientation of a subject's body joints in an image or video frame. \n\nThese two tasks are often intertwined, as body pose can provide valuable information for action recognition. For example, if you see a person's hand moving up and down, you can infer that they are waving. Conversely, action recognition can help to refine pose estimation by providing additional context and constraints on the plausible body poses. \n\nIn recent years, there has been significant progress in both action recognition and pose estimation, thanks to the development of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs are particularly well-suited for these tasks because they can learn to extract hierarchical features from images and videos, which can be used to represent body pose and action dynamics. \n\nA number of benchmark datasets have been developed for evaluating action recognition and pose estimation methods, such as the UCF101 and MPII Human Pose datasets.
