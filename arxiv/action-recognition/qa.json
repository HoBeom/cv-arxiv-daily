While CLIP has shown impressive results for zero-shot\nimage recognition, it cannot effectively recognize novel actions in\nvideos. This paper aims to transform CLIP to a strong zero-shot\nvideo classifier with minimal modifications.\nthe need for manual annotations makes it particularly useful\nin real-world applications. While extensive studies have\nbeen conducted on zero-shot learning (Zellers & Choi, 2017;\nBrattoli et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2017), CLIP (Radford et al.,\n2021) recently demonstrates surprising zero-shot abilities in\na variety of tasks, such as image segmentation (Wang et al.,\n2022; Ghiasi et al., 2021; 2022), image editing (Zheng et al.,\n2022; Crowson et al., 2022), by pretraining on web-scale\nimage and text pairs in a contrastive manner.\nWhile significant zero-shot results are achieved in the image\ndomain, limited effort has been made to explore CLIP for\nzero-shot video action recognition. Extending CLIP, de-\nsigned for image tasks, to the video domain, is extremely\nchallenging, particularly in the zero-shot setting. On one\nhand, to better recognize actions and events in videos, the\nrich temporal dynamics encoded in videos are expected to\nbe carefully captured. Although one could treat videos as\na bag of frames and perform temporal pooling over frame-\nbased predictions (Wang et al., 2021), it is found that fine-\ntuning pretrained models like CLIP with specialized tem-\nporal modeling components on top of off-the-shelf image\nmodels produces better results (Ni et al., 2022). However,\nthe improved results come at the cost of reduced general-\nization as optimizing specialized parameters will inevitably\nrequires fine-tuning the pretrained CLIP model. The derived\nmodel then tends to overfit to the video dataset used for fine-\ntuning, which are substantially smaller than the image-text\ndataset used to train CLIP. As a result, the zero-shot ability\n1\narXiv:2302.00624v3  [cs.CV]  31 May 2023\n Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\nof CLIP diminishes over the course of fine-tuning.\nIt is worth noting that the start point of the fine-tuning pro-\ncess is CLIP, an image classifier with strong zero-shot abil-\nities, while the end point is a specialized model for video\nunderstanding. This motivates us to seek a middle ground\nbetween generalization and specialization\u2014adapting a pre-\ntrained CLIP model to the video domain, and the resulting\nmodel is expected to not only recognize known actions and\nevents seen during training but also enjoy the zero-shot\nlearning abilities as CLIP for novel video categories. In-\nterestingly, we discover from a theoretical perspective that\nthis problem is essentially a continual learning problem,\nwhich aims to adapt a pretrained model to new tasks with\nless forgetting on previous knowledge. Traditional contin-\nual learning typically seeks decent performance on all seen\ntasks with access to historical data (Hu et al., 2021; Balaji\net al., 2020; Shin et al., 2017). However, this is particularly\nchallenging for adapting CLIP as raw data used for train-\ning are private. Furthermore, our goal is slightly beyond\ncontinual learning: we hope to adapt CLIP to be a strong\nzero-shot video learner that generalizes well to unknown\nvideo actions and events, rather than exactly preserving its\nknowledge for image tasks, which again is difficult without\naccess to the training data of CLIP.\nWith this in mind, we explore the problem of constructing\nan open-vocabulary video CLIP by simply leveraging the\npretrained weights that are publicly available. More specifi-\ncally, we build upon CLIP with minimal modifications so as\nto derive a video action recognition model that can not only\ncapture temporal information among different frames but\nalso generalizes well to unseen actions and events during\ntesting. To optimize the continual learning-based training\nformulation, we propose a novel method called Interpolated\nWeight Optimization which regularizes the fine-tuning pro-\ncess of the CLIP model by adding a link between the original\nCLIP model and the current model. This prevents the de-\nrived model from drifting away from CLIP, which we argue\nis beneficial for generalization. Furthermore, in addition to\ntraining, we also link derived optima along the optimization\ntrajectory at test time for improved generalization.\nWe conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the perfor-\nmance of Open-VCLIP. In particular, we use Kinetics-\n400 as a proxy dataset to extend CLIP to the video do-\nmain and evaluate its zero-shot performance on UCF-101,\nHMDB-51 and Kinetics-600 with various evaluation proto-\ncols. Open-VCLIP achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot video\naction recognition performance, offering 87.9%, 58.3%,\n81.1% zero-shot accuracy on UCF, HMDB and Kinetics-600\nrespectively, which are 8.3%, 7.8% and 12.2% better com-\npared to alternative methods. Furthermore, Open-VCLIP\nalso achieves the best trade-off between close-set and zero-\nshot performance across all the benchmarks.\n2. Related Work\nZero-shot Video Action Recognition. Zero-shot video\naction recognition requires models to recognize new ac-\ntions that are not seen during training, which is useful in\nreal-world applications where data and their corresponding\nlabels are difficult to collect. Early work focuses more on\nhow to represent actions properly. For example, manually-\ncrafted attributes (Liu et al., 2011; Zellers & Choi, 2017),\nobject features (Jain et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2019) are used\nto represent actions. Researchers also use word embeddings\nof actions (Brattoli et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2017) as textual\nsemantic representations. Recently, pretraining with large-\nscale vision-text data is gaining attention, as it achieves\nimpressive results for zero-shot image classification (Rad-\nford et al., 2021; Jia et al., 2021). There is also a plethora\nof work using knowledge learned in large-scale pretrained\nvision-language models to down-stream tasks in a zero-shot\nmanner (Wang et al., 2022; Ghiasi et al., 2021; 2022). While\nextensive studies have been conducted for zero-shot image\nunderstanding, zero-shot video classification remains less\nexplored. ActionCLIP (Wang et al., 2021) and XCLIP ex-\nperiment with zero-shot setting for action recognition (Ni\net al., 2022), but use the same strategy as in images for\nzero-shot learning and ignore the forgetting problem when\nadapting the CLIP model. In contrast, our goal is to explic-\nitly build a strong open-vocabulary zero-shot video classifier\nby regularizing the fine-tuning process.\nContinual Learning. Continual learning aims at training\na model on multiple sequential tasks without catastrophi-\ncally forgetting knowledge from previous tasks. Existing\napproaches can be divided into three categories: memory-\nbased, expansion based and regularization-based methods.\nMemory-based methods typically utilize a replay buffer to\nstore past examples or related information such as gradients\n(Farajtabar et al., 2020). In addition, memory replay is ef-\nfective for continual learning (Hu et al., 2021; Balaji et al.,\n2020), however, in our case, it is not feasible to directly\nuse these approaches as historical data are not available.\nExpansion-based methods (Rusu et al., 2016) expand the\nnetwork over time in order to maintain past performance.\nClosest to our approach, perhaps are regularization-based\nmethods (Yin et al., 2020) such as EWC (Kirkpatrick et al.,\n2017), which add a regularization term to the optimization\nthat constrains new model weights to be close to the original\nones. But still historical data need to be used to calculate the\nFisher information matrix for approaches like (Kirkpatrick\net al., 2017). Our approach differs from standard continual\nlearning in that we wish to transfer the knowledge, i.e. the\nability to perform zero-shot learning, from a previous image\ntask to video tasks without access to historical data at all.\n2\n Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\n3. Preliminary: Video Action Recognition\nUsing CLIP\nVideo action recognition is a fundamental yet challeng-\ning task that often requires intensive model training on\nlarge-scale datasets. Inspired by the success of contrastive\nlanguage-image pretraining (CLIP) (Radford et al., 2021),\nrecent work has proposed to fine-tune the well-trained CLIP\nmodel on the target video dataset and has achieved state-of-\nthe-art results (Xu et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2023).\nTo adapt CLIP for video action recognition (VCLIP), a\ncommon strategy (Arnab et al., 2021; Bulat et al., 2021;\nBertasius et al., 2021; Xing et al., 2022) is to extend the\nimage encoder to capture temporal dynamics in videos and,\nin the meanwhile, align the video representation with the\ntext representations of its corresponding label (e.g., \u201cplaying\ndrums\u201d). Specifically, given a video clip V \u2208VB and an\naction label described in textual prompts T \u2208TB, the goal\nof fine-tuning is to maximize the similarity:\nsim(v, t) = \u27e8v, t\u27e9\n\u2225v\u2225\u2225t\u2225,\nv = f\u03b8V\nB (V ), t = f\u03b8T\nB(T),\n(1)\nif V and T represent the same video. Here, VB denotes\nthe video dataset for task B, TB denotes the corresponding\nlabel set, f\u03b8T\nB denotes the text encoder and f\u03b8V\nB denotes\nthe visual encoder. As the text encoder is typically frozen\n(Ilharco et al., 2022; Thengane et al., 2022), the fine-tuning\nstage primarily focuses on optimizing the visual encoder for\nadaptation to the video domain. We drop the superscript in\nthe subsequent paragraphs for brevity.\n4. Our Approach\nWe introduce our approach in this section which consists of\ntwo major components: (1) constructing a VCLIP model\nfrom the image-based CLIP in order to better explore spatial-\ntemporal relationships in videos, and (2) regularizing the\nfine-tuning process so that the derived model can generalize\nwell to unseen actions and events.\n4.1. Constructing VCLIP for Video Understanding\nTemporal relations among video frames contain important\ninformation for identifying actions. The image CLIP model\ndoes not have the ability to aggregate temporal features and\nthus is no longer suitable for video tasks. So we devote\nto injecting temporal modeling ability to the original CLIP\nmodel for a better transfer from images to videos.\nAdding additional temporal modeling networks is the most\nconvenient way to achieve this, however, this generally in-\ncurs extra parameters that are computationally expensive\nand makes it harder for weight interpolation that greatly\nbenefits zero-shot abilities, as will be described later. We\nobserve that the self-attention layer in vision transformer is\nquite scalable, operating on image frame patches as:\nys,t = Softmax(qs,tKT\nt\n\u221a\nd\n)Vt,\n(2)\nwhere d refers to the dimention of vectors, qs,t refers to\nthe query vector of the s-th token in the t-th frame, KT\nt\nis the transpose of the matrix composed of key vectors in\nthe t-th frame, and Vt is the matrix composed of value\nvectors in the t-th frame. Obviously, each token will only\nobtain information from its belonging frame. To overcome\nthis issue, we expand the temporal attention view for ev-\nery self-attention layer for aggregating the global temporal\ninformation thanks to the stacking of self-attention layers.\nThe new self-attention layer is implemented as follows:\nys,t = Softmax\n\u0012qs,t[K(t\u22121)\u223c(t+1)]T\n\u221a\nd\n\u0013\n[V(t\u22121)\u223c(t+1)].\n(3)\nAt this time, each patch will obtain information from its\nbelonging frame and its neighbouring frames. The spe-\ncial modification lies in [K(t\u22121)\u223c(t+1)] and [V(t\u22121)\u223c(t+1)]\nwhich refers to the Key/Value matrix be composed with\nkey/value vectors belonging to not only the t-th frame, but\nalso the neighbour frames. Such a small modification helps\nthe model to gain better temporal information aggregation\nability, while perfectly fitting our algorithm since no extra\nparameters are added.\n4.2. Training Open-VCLIP\nWe now introduce the training method with a carefully de-\nsigned optimization strategy for improved zero-shot video\nclassification. We start by formulating the problem from its\noriginal purpose and then derive its approximation which\nleads to a challenging continual learning problem with zero\nhistorical data. We propose a novel regularization-based\nmethod to optimize VCLIP, named Interpolated Weight\nRegularization (IWR). A model-averaging approach called\nStochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) is further incorporated\nto improve model generalizability.\n4.2.1. PROBLEM DEFINITION\nWhile fine-tuning the CLIP model yields impressive results\nfor close-set video classification (Wang et al., 2021; Ni et al.,\n2022), its performance on unseen categories is poor\u2014might\nbe worse than the original CLIP model as shown in Table 4.\nBelow, we elaborate on how to construct a robust open-\nvocabulary video model from a pretrained CLIP model.\nFormally, our goal is to obtain the optimal vision encoder\nf\u03b8U that satisfies:\n\u03b8U = arg min\n\u03b8\nL(\u03b8; DU).\n(4)\nHere, DU = {VU, TU} is a hypothetical universal dataset\nthat contains all possible videos and their corresponding\n3\n Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\ntext descriptions (i.e., action labels). L is the loss function\ndefined on the video-text pairs. Optimizing such an objec-\ntive directly is infeasible, yet luckily it can be approximated\nby training on a large-scale dataset with sufficiently diverse\nvideo and text data.\n4.2.2. AN APPROXIMATION EQUIVALENT TO\nCONTINUAL LEARNING\nWe first consider a video action recognition dataset DB =\n{VB, TB} used for fine-tuning. Unfortunately, even though\nthe abundant video data VB serve as a good approximation\nof VU, its text space is extremely limited, bounded by the\nnumber of annotated action categories (e.g., |TB| = 400\nfor Kinetics-400 (Kay et al., 2017)). As a result, the video\nrepresentation is prone to overfitting to the highly skewed\ntext space and the zero-shot ability of the CLIP model di-\nminishes over the fine-tuning process. On the other hand,\nthe scale of the image training dataset for CLIP, is suffi-\nciently large to approximate DU, but there exists a domain\ngap between the image space and the video space. Even\nworse, this dataset is a private dataset and only the CLIP\nmodel weights \u03b8A are accessible for fine-tuning.\nWith these pros and cons in mind, we now seek to lever-\nage both \u03b8A and DB to construct a strong open-vocabulary\nmodel. We believe that \u03b8A should contain useful informa-\ntion from the large image dataset that CLIP was originally\ntrained on. Following this intuition, we notice that the initial\nVCLIP model (without any fine-tuning) \u03b8A is indeed an\noptimal solution to a large-scale video dataset DA with a\nsufficiently diverse text space TA (Lemma 4.1).\nLemma 4.1. Suppose the image CLIP model was trained\non an image-text dataset D \u00af\nA = {I \u00af\nA, T \u00af\nA} with N ex-\namples.\nThen, there exists a diverse video-text dataset\nDA = {VA, TA} containing N examples where the video\nCLIP model with original CLIP parameters \u03b8A is optimal.\nProof. See Appendix.\nAlthough DA is unknown, it is helpful to understand our\nproblem. Given the fact that \u03b8A is an optimal solution in\na large scale dataset DA, a natural idea for approximating\nthe universal objective is to combine both datasets in the\nderivation, although DA is unknown in reality.\nFollowing this idea, Equation (4) is transformed into:\narg min\n\u03b8\nL(\u03b8; DA) + L(\u03b8; DB)\n(5)\nwhere DA is completely unknown and only DB is present.\nHowever, we have the optimal solution \u03b8A on DA. In that\ncase, the formulation becomes equivalent to continual learn-\ning, i.e., continually training the model on a new dataset\nwhile preserving its performance on historical data so as to\nachieve sufficient generalizability.\n4.2.3. INTERPOLATED WEIGHT REGULARIZATION\nWhile there have been many methods of studying continual\nlearning, most of them are based on storing historical data\nor information, which is not applicable in our case. It is due\nto the fact that we do not have access to DA at all. Inspired\nby empirical results in (Ilharco et al., 2022), we propose to\nlowing the first loss term in Equation (5) by introducing an\noptimization-free weight interpolation strategy:\n\u03b8 = \u03bb\u03b8A + (1 \u2212\u03bb)\u03b8B,\n(6)\nwhere \u03bb is a trade-off hyperparameter. Equation (6) is called\nmodel patching (Ilharco et al., 2022), which is commonly\nused between two converged model weights, i.e., \u03b8B is\ntrained separately on DB only. A potential risk of this\nmethod is that we have no explicit optimization on the curve\nfitting performance of the final patched model, i.e., the patch\nmay be severely underfitting to DB or sensitive to the trade-\noff parameter \u03bb.\nTo address this issue, we propose Interpolated Weight Reg-\nularization as part of the training procedure, which regu-\nlarizes the loss of the interpolated weights on DB. Given\nthat the \u03bb is a hyperparameter that may vary, instead of opti-\nmizing a single point, we look for a solution such that the\npatched model\u2019s performance w.r.t. a range of interpolation\ncoefficients are optimized. This is achieved by sampling a\nbalancing coefficient during training. The final optimization\nobjective becomes:\narg min\n\u03b8B\nL = L(\u03b8B; DB) + \u03b2L(\u03b1\u03b8A + (1 \u2212\u03b1)\u03b8B; DB)\n(7)\nwhere \u03b1 \u223cU(0, \u03bb). The (0, \u03bb) interval corresponds to the\nlow-level region between the interpolated and end weights.\n\u03b2 is the trade-off coefficient for regularization and it is set as\n\u03b2 = C\n1\n1\u2212\u03b1 in practice where C is a constant value. The loss\ncan be optimized by calculating its derivative as follows:\ndL\nd\u03b8 = dL\nd\u03b8\n\f\n\f\n\f\n\f\n\u03b8=\u03b8B\n+ \u03b2(1 \u2212\u03b1) dL\nd\u03b8\n\f\n\f\n\f\n\f\n\u03b8=\u03b1\u03b8A+(1\u2212\u03b1)\u03b8B\n(8)\n= dL\nd\u03b8\n\f\n\f\n\f\n\f\n\u03b8=\u03b8B\n+ C dL\nd\u03b8\n\f\n\f\n\f\n\f\n\u03b8=\u03b1\u03b8A+(1\u2212\u03b1)\u03b8B\n.\n(9)\nAfter we obtain the optimal \u03b8B, Equation (6) is applied to\nachieve the final VCLIP model weights.\n4.2.4. STOCHASTIC WEIGHT AVERAGING\nImproved zero-shot predicting ability lies in good general-\nization ability. We further introduce an upgrade to the above\nmethod by applying Stochastic Weight Average (SWA) on\nthe interpolated weights along the training process to find\nthe \u201cflat minimum\u201d, which refer to a region in the weight\nspace where the loss function is relatively flat and the test\nerror is relatively low according to (Izmailov et al., 2018).\n4\n Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\nEquation (10) showcases our solution:\nN\nX\ni\n\u03bb\u03b8A + (1 \u2212\u03bb)\u03b8i\nN\n= \u03bb\u03b8A + (1 \u2212\u03bb)\n1\nN\nN\nX\ni\n\u03b8i\n(10)\nwhere \u03b8i refers to the i-th set of parameters we select during\nthe training process. As Equation (10) shows, the moving\naverage of the interpolated weights equals to interpolat-\ning the moving average of the updated weights, showing\nthe order of the SWA and the weight interpolation is inter-\nchangable. So, in practice, we maintain the moving average\nof the model\u2019s weights during training and do weight inter-\npolation in the end. By averaging model weights from the\noptimization trajectories, we will get a robust model with\nbetter generalization to unseen classes.\n4.3.

Experiments\nWe present in this section our experimental evaluation. We\ncompare our Open-VCLIP method with state-of-the-art\nvideo models and perform ablation studies to reveal the\ncharacteristics of our method.\n5.1. Experimental Setup\n5.1.1. DATASETS\nIn our experiments, we use the following four datasets:\nKinetics-400&600: Kinetics-400 (Kay et al., 2017) and\nKinetics-600 (Carreira et al., 2018) datasets are large-scale\ndatasets for human action recognition, containing 400 and\n600 action classes, respectively. The Kinetics-600 dataset is\nan extension of the Kinetics-400 dataset, including 220 new\ncategories. These additional classes provide a valuable re-\nsource for evaluating the zero-shot ability of models trained\non the Kinetics-400. Each video is a 10-second around\naction moment annotated from YouTube videos.\nUCF-101: The UCF-101 dataset (Soomro et al., 2012) is\na widely used dataset for human action recognition, which\ncontains 13,320 video clips from 101 action categories.\nEach video in the dataset is a short clip of an action, with an\naverage length of 7.21 seconds, that is captured from real-\nworld scenarios. Officially, three different training/testing\nsplits files are provided.\nHMDB-51: HMDB-51 (Kuehne et al., 2011) contains 6,849\nclips divided into 51 action categories with each category\ncontaining at least 101 clips. Officially, three different train-\ning/testing splits are provided to evaluate the model. To\nensure a balance in the number of samples per category,\n1,746 videos are left \u201cunused\u201d in each split, while each cate-\ngory is guaranteed to have 70 training samples and 30 test\nsamples. Having a consistent number of testing samples for\neach category allows for a fair evaluation.\nWe use the Kinetics-400 dataset as the training set and use\nUCF-101, HMDB-51, and a subset of the Kinetics-600\ndataset as test datasets. By testing on datasets that contain\nno/few overlapping categories with the training dataset, we\nare able to provide a realistic and comprehensive evaluation\nof the zero-shot capabilities. Detailed evaluation protocols\nare described below.\n5.1.2. EVALUATION PROTOCOLS\nUCF-101&HMDB-51: Following (Brattoli et al., 2020)\nand (Ni et al., 2022), there are three protocols for zero-shot\nevaluation on these two datasets.\n\u2022 Evaluation Protocol 1 (EP1): We first randomly choose\nhalf of the classes in the test dataset, i.e., 50 for UCF\nand 25 for HMDB, and repeat ten times and report\naveraged results for each dataset. (Brattoli et al., 2020)\n\u2022 Evaluation Protocol 2 (EP2): We test the model on\nfull UCF and HMDB, i.e., evaluating on all 101 UCF\nclasses and all 51 HMDB classes (Brattoli et al., 2020).\n5\n Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\nTable 1.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nThe initial learning rate is set to 3.33 \u00d7 10\u22126 and is decayed\nto 3.33 \u00d7 10\u22128 following the cosine decay scheduler. We\nuse 2 epochs to warm up the training and another 20 epochs\nfor fine-tuning on Kinetics-400. Th learning rate for warm-\nup is set to 3.33 \u00d7 10\u22128 and we use 8 GPUs for training,\neach contains a batch of 8 samples. Since we are performing\nvision-text alignment during the training process, augmen-\ntations such as mixup and cutmix significantly impact the\nalignment process. Therefore, we do not use them to avoid\nany potential negative effects for alignment. Instead, we\nsimply use basic augmentations like color jittering, random\nflipping, and random cropping. Each video clip is extracted\nevery 16 frames for a total of 8 frames to form an input video\nclip. During testing, 3 clips with 1 crop (\u201c3 \u00d7 1 views\u201d)\nper video will be sampled to produce a prediction and the\nresults will be further aggregated linearly. Furthermore, we\nset the interval of regularization to (0.0, 0.6), the balance\nratio C of the regularization is set to 0.5, and we start SWA\nfrom the second epoch when the warm-up stage finishes.\n5.2. Main Results\n5.2.1. COMPARISON TO STATE-OF-THE-ARTS\nWe compare our method to state-of-the-art zero-shot video\naction recognition methods using the UCF-101, HMDB-51,\nand a subset of Kinetics-600 datasets for evaluation. We\nfirst present the results under Evaluation Protocol 1 and\nEvaluation Protocol 2, summarized in Table 1. The first\nblock of Table 1 presents methods that do not rely on large-\nscale vision-language pretrained models, while the last two\nblocks of Table 1 show the performance of CLIP-based\nmethods that transfer the image CLIP model to the video\ndomain by fine-tuning on the Kinetics-400 dataset.\nAs shown in the table, the results of CLIP-based methods,\ni.e. ActionCLIP, TEXT3VIS, and ours, are significantly bet-\nter than other methods. This indicates that knowledge from\nlarge-scale vision-language pretrained models is important\nfor zero-shot video action recognition performance. Fur-\nthermore, when using the ViT-B/16 encoder, our method\noutperforms ActionCLIP by 14% (83.5% vs 69.5%) and\n2.7% (53.2% vs 50.5%); when using the ViT-L/14 encoder,\nour method outperforms TEXT4VIS by 8.3% (87.9% vs\n79.6%) and 8.5% (58.3% vs 49.8%). These substantial\nimprovements in accuracy highlight that our approach can\neffectively adapt the CLIP model to the video domain for\nimproved zero-shot recognition. We also compare with X-\nCLIP (Ni et al., 2022) under Evaluation Protocol 3 on UCF\nand HMDB datasets. Results in Table 2 reveal that Open-\nVCLIP outperforms X-CLIP by 11.4% (83.4% vs 72.0%)\non UCF and 9.3% (53.9% vs 44.6%) on HMDB using ViT-\nB/16, suggesting the effectiveness of our approach.\nAs for Kinetics-600 dataset, as shown in Table 3, we see that\nour method also performs favorably, especially compared to\nX-CLIP (Ni et al., 2022) and TEXT4VIS (Wu et al., 2023).\n6\n Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\nTable 2.

RESULTS WITH DIFFERENT BACKBONES\nWe compare Open-VCLIP with the CLIP baseline and stan-\ndard fine-tuning using various backbone networks. In par-\nticular, the results in the \u201cCLIP\u2217\u201d column of Table 4 show\nthe performance of the pretrained CLIP model, which pre-\ndicts each image frame of the video seperately. The \u201cFINE-\nTUNE\u201d column shows the results of a standard fine-tuning\nprocess using the same model as Open-VCLIP. We see\nfrom Table 4 that larger backbone networks (ViT-L/14 >\nViT-B/16 > ViT-B/32) consistently improve zero-shot per-\nformance. For example, the results in the \u201cCLIP\u2217\u201d column\nshow that the ViT-L/14 model outperforms the ViT-B/16 by\n6.3% (80.5% vs 74.2%), 7.4% (55.0% vs 47.6%), and 8.1%\n(76.2% vs 68.1%) on the UCF, HMDB, and Kinetics-600\ndatasets, respectively, while similar trends can be found in\nthe last two columns of Table 4, demonstrating that larger-\nscale vision-language pretrained models contain stronger\nzero-shot knowledge and are more robust when transferred\nfrom image to video tasks. However, as we can see from\nthe results of \u201cFINE-TUNE\u201d and \u201cCLIP\u2217\u201d in Table 4, the\nfine-tuning process does not always result in improved per-\nformance. For example, the fine-tuning process leads to\nworse zero-shot results on the HMDB dataset when using\nthe ViT-L/14 backbone, and all zero-shot testing results on\nthe Kinetics-600 show a performance drop after models are\nfine-tuned on Kinetics-400 under a standard paradigm. The\nresults indicate that the knowledge stored in CLIP cannot\nalways be transferred with conventional fine-tuning.\nCompared to the baselines, our approach demonstrates sig-\nnificant and consistent improvements in zero-shot video\naction recognition across various datasets and models, as\nshown in the last column of Table 4. Taking experimental\nresults on Kinetics-600 as an example, our approach not\nonly avoids the performance drop seen in the \u201cFINE-TUNE\u201d\nmethod, but also significantly improves zero-shot recogni-\ntion. This highlights the effectiveness of our method in ef-\nfectively using annotated video datasets with limited labels\nfor transfer learning and effectively preventing knowledge\nfrom forgetting, offering stable and decent results.\n5.3. Discussion and Ablation Studies\nThe effectiveness of temporal modeling and weight inter-\npolation. We also investigate whether temporal modeling is\nneeded for transferring CLIP to the video domain. To this\nend, we compare the performance of the CLIP, VCLIP, and\nOpen-VCLIP, represented by green, blue and red curves in\nFigure 2, respectively. In particular, VCLIP expands the\noriginal spatial attention of CLIP to spatial-temporal atten-\ntion without additional parameters as in Open-VCLIP. The\ncurves illustrate weight interpolations with different mixing\ncoefficients between CLIP and the fine-tuned model. Con-\ncretely, the y-axis displays the accuracy on the zero-shot\nvideo dataset, while the x-axis displays accuracy on the\nfine-tunning dataset, Kinetics-400.\nComparing the tails of the green and blue curves, we see\nthat VCLIP achieves not only better close-set performance,\nbut also better zero-shot performance on all of the three\ndatasets. At the same time, when applying weight interpola-\ntion with different ratios, VCLIP achieves better trade-off\nthan CLIP, as evidenced by the fact that the blue curve is\nalways on top of the green curve in Figure 2. This strongly\nsuggests the significant advantages that come with incorpo-\nrating temporal modeling in the context of zero-shot video\naction recognition.\n7\n Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\nFigure 2. We evaluate the effectiveness of temporal modeling and weight interpolation with a VCLIP B/16 model. Points on each curve\nrepresent interpolation ratios of 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.0 from left to right, respectively. The red star marks correspond to our\nreported main results. We test on the full UCF, HMDB and the first split in (Chen & Huang, 2021) on Kinetics-600.\nFigure 3. We evaluate the effectiveness of IWR and SWA with a VCLIP B/16 on the full UCF, HMDB and the first split in (Chen &\nHuang, 2021) on Kinetics-600.\nFigure 4. We compare Open-VCLIP with an \u21132 regularization imposed on weigths on the full UCF, HMDB and the first split in (Chen &\nHuang, 2021) on Kinetics-600.\nFurthermore, the clear margins observed between the red\ncurves and the other curves in Figure 2 show that our pro-\nposed solution achieves the best trade-off compared to pure\nfine-tuning. With the same-level of close-set results, our\napproach always produces better zero-shot accuracy. In ad-\ndition, the star marks on the red curves, which correspond to\nthe reported main results in Tables 1 to 3, are always better\nthan the other baseline curves.\nIWR v.s. SWA. Our approach is composed of two weight\ninterpolation modules: IWR which is used during training\nto regularize the fine-tuning process and SWA to improve\ngeneralization. We investigate their contributions to the\nfinal results in Figure 3. Overall, removing either IWR\n(green curve) or SWA (yellow curve) from the model leads\nto significant drops, i.e. the red curve outperforms all other\ncurves, suggesting IWR and SWA are complimentary to\neach other. Furthermore, we see using only IWR or SWA is\nable to produce a good zero-shot performance improvement,\ncompared to the results with no interpolation at all.\nWeight regularization during fine-tuning. IWR is con-\nceptually similar to EWC (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017), which\npenalizes the changes of important parameters for solving\nprevious tasks. However, EWC needs to assess the impor-\ntance of parameters through historical data which is not\nfeasible to our setting. Instead, we simply constrain the\noptimization by penalizing the weight changes using an \u21132\nnorm. Concretely, we use the \u21132 distance between the up-\ndated weights and the original weights as the regularization\nloss term during training, assigning various weights to the\nregularization loss term. As shown in Figure 4, our method\nachieves the best trade-off. Open-VCLIP achieves higher\nclose-set and zero-shot accuracy across all the datasets com-\npared with simply applying an \u21132 normalization, demon-\nstrating the effectiveness of Open-VCLIP.\n8\n Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\nTable 5.

As-\nsessing the model via text-to-video/video-to-text retrieval\ntasks offers insight into its generalizability within the video\ndomain.\nWe follow the paradigm of training models\non Kinetics-400 dataset and testing them on MSR-VTT\ndataset (Xu et al., 2016), which is a large video description\ndataset. We firstly report the result of our own implemen-\ntation using CLIP for retrieval as shown in the third row\nof Table 5, which is similar to the results in (Portillo et al.,\n2021). This guarantees fair comparisons. Then, we evaluate\nOpen-VCLIP on MSR-VTT. We find that our text-to-video\nretrieval (given a text to retrieve the corresponding video)\nrecall is comparable to that of raw CLIP but with a much\nhigher close-set score on K400 (78.9% vs 57.5%). Further\nincreasing the mixing coefficient \u03bb improves the text-to-\nvideo retrieval performance of Open-VCLIP, surpassing the\nCLIP baseline by 2%. We also show that the video-to-text\nretrieval (given a video to retrieve the corresponding text)\nperformance of Open-VCLIP is significantly higher than\nthat of the CLIP baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness\nof our method in preserving the alignment capability when\ntransferring to video domains.\nComparison with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Fine-\ntuning only a part of the weights of a network is an ef-\nfective approach for adapting the CLIP model to video in\na parameter-efficient manner. A noteworthy method that\nemploys this strategy is the ST-Adapter (Pan et al., 2022),\nwhich accomplishes effective video classification by training\nadded adapter modules, while keeping the original param-\neters of the CLIP model frozen. We compare ST-Adapter\nwith our approach. More specifically, ST-Adapter forgoes\nthe text encoder of CLIP, while introducing an additional\nlinear classifier instead. This change prevents the model\nfrom being used in zero-shot testing. To circumvent this\nproblem, we incorporate the text encoder of CLIP into our\nimplementation of the ST-Adapter. The results presented\nin Table 6 illustrates that the ST-Adapter, while preserving\nthe original CLIP weights and only fine-tuning the added\nadapters, fails to match the performance of our proposed\nmethod in zero-shot action recognition. In particular, we\nobserve a marked degradation in the zero-shot performance\nof the ST-Adapter on the K600 dataset, suggesting that\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning does not effectively address\nthe issue of catastrophic forgetting.\nTable 6.

Conclusion\nWe presented Open-VCLIP, an effective approach that en-\nables CLIP to be transformed to an open-vocabulary video\nmodel. Open-VCLIP contains lightweight temporal mod-\neling modules that equip CLIP with the ability to capture\nspatial and temporal relationships in videos. More impor-\ntantly, Open-VCLIP is optimized with a carefully designed\nregularization strategy that strives for generalization to pre-\nserve the zero-shot abilities of CLIP. Extensive experiments\nare conducted and the results demonstrate that Open-VCLIP\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods with clear margins\non zero-shot video action recognition and achieves the best\ntrade-off between close-set and zero-shot video action recog-\nnition. One potential limitation is that adversaries could\ncraft membership inference attacks to steal information from\nthe model.\nAcknowledgements\nThis project was supported by NSFC under Grant No.\n62032006 and No. 62102092.

Suppose the image CLIP model was trained on an image-text dataset D \u00af\nA = {I \u00af\nA, T \u00af\nA} with N examples.\nThen, there exists a diverse video-text dataset DA = {VA, TA} containing N examples where the video CLIP model with\noriginal CLIP parameters \u03b8A is optimal.\nProof. We denote the large-scale visual-language pretraining dataset used to train CLIP as D \u00af\nA = {I \u00af\nA, T \u00af\nA}. To bridge\nthe gap between image and video domains, we extend images in D \u00af\nA by repeating frames to create a set of static videos\nVA = {Vi = [I \u00af\nAi, I \u00af\nAi, ..., I \u00af\nAi]}N and let TA = T \u00af\nA. Videos in DA = {VA, TA} are static and do not provide any additional\ninformation for prediction. As a result, \u03b8A which offers the best results for D \u00af\nA is also optimal on DA.\n12\n Open-VCLIP: Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\nvia Interpolated Weight Optimization\nZejia Weng1 2Xitong Yang3Ang Li4Zuxuan Wu1 2Yu-Gang Jiang1 2\nAbstract\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)\nhas demonstrated impressive zero-shot learning\nabilities for image understanding, yet limited\neffort has been made to investigate CLIP for\nzero-shot video recognition.

While CLIP has shown impressive results for zero-shot\nimage recognition, it cannot effectively recognize novel actions in\nvideos. This paper aims to transform CLIP to a strong zero-shot\nvideo classifier with minimal modifications.\nthe need for manual annotations makes it particularly useful\nin real-world applications. While extensive studies have\nbeen conducted on zero-shot learning (Zellers & Choi, 2017;\nBrattoli et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2017), CLIP (Radford et al.,\n2021) recently demonstrates surprising zero-shot abilities in\na variety of tasks, such as image segmentation (Wang et al.,\n2022; Ghiasi et al., 2021; 2022), image editing (Zheng et al.,\n2022; Crowson et al., 2022), by pretraining on web-scale\nimage and text pairs in a contrastive manner.\nWhile significant zero-shot results are achieved in the image\ndomain, limited effort has been made to explore CLIP for\nzero-shot video action recognition. Extending CLIP, de-\nsigned for image tasks, to the video domain, is extremely\nchallenging, particularly in the zero-shot setting. On one\nhand, to better recognize actions and events in videos, the\nrich temporal dynamics encoded in videos are expected to\nbe carefully captured. Although one could treat videos as\na bag of frames and perform temporal pooling over frame-\nbased predictions (Wang et al., 2021), it is found that fine-\ntuning pretrained models like CLIP with specialized tem-\nporal modeling components on top of off-the-shelf image\nmodels produces better results (Ni et al., 2022). However,\nthe improved results come at the cost of reduced general-\nization as optimizing specialized parameters will inevitably\nrequires fine-tuning the pretrained CLIP model. The derived\nmodel then tends to overfit to the video dataset used for fine-\ntuning, which are substantially smaller than the image-text\ndataset used to train CLIP. As a result, the zero-shot ability\n1arXiv:2302.00624v3  [cs.CV]  31 May 2023 Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\nof CLIP diminishes over the course of fine-tuning.\nIt is worth noting that the start point of the fine-tuning pro-\ncess is CLIP, an image classifier with strong zero-shot abil-\nities, while the end point is a specialized model for video\nunderstanding. This motivates us to seek a middle ground\nbetween generalization and specialization\u2014adapting a pre-\ntrained CLIP model to the video domain, and the resulting\nmodel is expected to not only recognize known actions and\nevents seen during training but also enjoy the zero-shot\nlearning abilities as CLIP for novel video categories. In-\nterestingly, we discover from a theoretical perspective that\nthis problem is essentially a continual learning problem,\nwhich aims to adapt a pretrained model to new tasks with\nless forgetting on previous knowledge. Traditional contin-\nual learning typically seeks decent performance on all seen\ntasks with access to historical data (Hu et al., 2021; Balaji\net al., 2020; Shin et al., 2017). However, this is particularly\nchallenging for adapting CLIP as raw data used for train-\ning are private. Furthermore, our goal is slightly beyond\ncontinual learning: we hope to adapt CLIP to be a strong\nzero-shot video learner that generalizes well to unknown\nvideo actions and events, rather than exactly preserving its\nknowledge for image tasks, which again is difficult without\naccess to the training data of CLIP.\nWith this in mind, we explore the problem of constructing\nan open-vocabulary video CLIP by simply leveraging the\npretrained weights that are publicly available. More specifi-\ncally, we build upon CLIP with minimal modifications so as\nto derive a video action recognition model that can not only\ncapture temporal information among different frames but\nalso generalizes well to unseen actions and events during\ntesting. To optimize the continual learning-based training\nformulation, we propose a novel method called Interpolated\nWeight Optimization which regularizes the fine-tuning pro-\ncess of the CLIP model by adding a link between the original\nCLIP model and the current model. This prevents the de-\nrived model from drifting away from CLIP, which we argue\nis beneficial for generalization. Furthermore, in addition to\ntraining, we also link derived optima along the optimization\ntrajectory at test time for improved generalization.\nWe conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the perfor-\nmance of Open-VCLIP. In particular, we use Kinetics-\n400 as a proxy dataset to extend CLIP to the video do-\nmain and evaluate its zero-shot performance on UCF-101,\nHMDB-51 and Kinetics-600 with various evaluation proto-\ncols. Open-VCLIP achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot video\naction recognition performance, offering 87.9%, 58.3%,\n81.1% zero-shot accuracy on UCF, HMDB and Kinetics-600\nrespectively, which are 8.3%, 7.8% and 12.2% better com-\npared to alternative methods. Furthermore, Open-VCLIP\nalso achieves the best trade-off between close-set and zero-\nshot performance across all the benchmarks.2. Related Work\nZero-shot Video Action Recognition. Zero-shot video\naction recognition requires models to recognize new ac-\ntions that are not seen during training, which is useful in\nreal-world applications where data and their corresponding\nlabels are difficult to collect. Early work focuses more on\nhow to represent actions properly. For example, manually-\ncrafted attributes (Liu et al., 2011; Zellers & Choi, 2017),\nobject features (Jain et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2019) are used\nto represent actions. Researchers also use word embeddings\nof actions (Brattoli et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2017) as textual\nsemantic representations. Recently, pretraining with large-\nscale vision-text data is gaining attention, as it achieves\nimpressive results for zero-shot image classification (Rad-\nford et al., 2021; Jia et al., 2021). There is also a plethora\nof work using knowledge learned in large-scale pretrained\nvision-language models to down-stream tasks in a zero-shot\nmanner (Wang et al., 2022; Ghiasi et al., 2021; 2022). While\nextensive studies have been conducted for zero-shot image\nunderstanding, zero-shot video classification remains less\nexplored. ActionCLIP (Wang et al., 2021) and XCLIP ex-\nperiment with zero-shot setting for action recognition (Ni\net al., 2022), but use the same strategy as in images for\nzero-shot learning and ignore the forgetting problem when\nadapting the CLIP model. In contrast, our goal is to explic-\nitly build a strong open-vocabulary zero-shot video classifier\nby regularizing the fine-tuning process.\nContinual Learning. Continual learning aims at training\na model on multiple sequential tasks without catastrophi-\ncally forgetting knowledge from previous tasks. Existing\napproaches can be divided into three categories: memory-\nbased, expansion based and regularization-based methods.\nMemory-based methods typically utilize a replay buffer to\nstore past examples or related information such as gradients\n(Farajtabar et al., 2020). In addition, memory replay is ef-\nfective for continual learning (Hu et al., 2021; Balaji et al.,\n2020), however, in our case, it is not feasible to directly\nuse these approaches as historical data are not available.\nExpansion-based methods (Rusu et al., 2016) expand the\nnetwork over time in order to maintain past performance.\nClosest to our approach, perhaps are regularization-based\nmethods (Yin et al., 2020) such as EWC (Kirkpatrick et al.,\n2017), which add a regularization term to the optimization\nthat constrains new model weights to be close to the original\nones. But still historical data need to be used to calculate the\nFisher information matrix for approaches like (Kirkpatrick\net al., 2017). Our approach differs from standard continual\nlearning in that we wish to transfer the knowledge, i.e.the\nability to perform zero-shot learning, from a previous image\ntask to video tasks without access to historical data at all.\n2 Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\n3. Preliminary: Video Action Recognition\nUsing CLIP\nVideo action recognition is a fundamental yet challeng-\ning task that often requires intensive model training on\nlarge-scale datasets. Inspired by the success of contrastive\nlanguage-image pretraining (CLIP) (Radford et al., 2021),\nrecent work has proposed to fine-tune the well-trained CLIP\nmodel on the target video dataset and has achieved state-of-\nthe-art results (Xu et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2023).\nTo adapt CLIP for video action recognition (VCLIP), a\ncommon strategy (Arnab et al., 2021; Bulat et al., 2021;\nBertasius et al., 2021; Xing et al., 2022) is to extend the\nimage encoder to capture temporal dynamics in videos and,\nin the meanwhile, align the video representation with the\ntext representations of its corresponding label ( e.g., \u201cplaying\ndrums\u201d). Specifically, given a video clip V\u2208 VBand an\naction label described in textual prompts T\u2208 TB, the goal\nof fine-tuning is to maximize the similarity:\nsim(v, t) =\u27e8v, t\u27e9\n\u2225v\u2225\u2225t\u2225, v =f\u03b8V\nB(V), t=f\u03b8T\nB(T),(1)\nifVandTrepresent the same video. Here, VBdenotes\nthe video dataset for task B,TBdenotes the corresponding\nlabel set, f\u03b8T\nBdenotes the text encoder and f\u03b8V\nBdenotes\nthe visual encoder. As the text encoder is typically frozen\n(Ilharco et al., 2022; Thengane et al., 2022), the fine-tuning\nstage primarily focuses on optimizing the visual encoder for\nadaptation to the video domain. We drop the superscript in\nthe subsequent paragraphs for brevity.\n4. Our Approach\nWe introduce our approach in this section which consists of\ntwo major components: (1) constructing a VCLIP model\nfrom the image-based CLIP in order to better explore spatial-\ntemporal relationships in videos, and (2) regularizing the\nfine-tuning process so that the derived model can generalize\nwell to unseen actions and events.\n4.1. Constructing VCLIP for Video Understanding\nTemporal relations among video frames contain important\ninformation for identifying actions. The image CLIP model\ndoes not have the ability to aggregate temporal features and\nthus is no longer suitable for video tasks. So we devote\nto injecting temporal modeling ability to the original CLIP\nmodel for a better transfer from images to videos.\nAdding additional temporal modeling networks is the most\nconvenient way to achieve this, however, this generally in-\ncurs extra parameters that are computationally expensive\nand makes it harder for weight interpolation that greatly\nbenefits zero-shot abilities, as will be described later. We\nobserve that the self-attention layer in vision transformer isquite scalable, operating on image frame patches as:\nys,t=Softmax (qs,tKT\nt\u221a\nd)Vt, (2)\nwhere drefers to the dimention of vectors, qs,trefers to\nthe query vector of the s-th token in the t-th frame, KT\nt\nis the transpose of the matrix composed of key vectors in\nthet-th frame, and Vtis the matrix composed of value\nvectors in the t-th frame. Obviously, each token will only\nobtain information from its belonging frame. To overcome\nthis issue, we expand the temporal attention view for ev-\nery self-attention layer for aggregating the global temporal\ninformation thanks to the stacking of self-attention layers.\nThe new self-attention layer is implemented as follows:\nys,t=Softmax\u0012qs,t[K(t\u22121)\u223c(t+1)]T\n\u221a\nd\u0013\n[V(t\u22121)\u223c(t+1)].\n(3)\nAt this time, each patch will obtain information from its\nbelonging frame and its neighbouring frames. The spe-\ncial modification lies in [K(t\u22121)\u223c(t+1)]and[V(t\u22121)\u223c(t+1)]\nwhich refers to the Key/Value matrix be composed with\nkey/value vectors belonging to not only the t-th frame, but\nalso the neighbour frames. Such a small modification helps\nthe model to gain better temporal information aggregation\nability, while perfectly fitting our algorithm since no extra\nparameters are added.\n4.2. Training Open-VCLIP\nWe now introduce the training method with a carefully de-\nsigned optimization strategy for improved zero-shot video\nclassification. We start by formulating the problem from its\noriginal purpose and then derive its approximation which\nleads to a challenging continual learning problem with zero\nhistorical data. We propose a novel regularization-based\nmethod to optimize VCLIP, named Interpolated Weight\nRegularization (IWR). A model-averaging approach called\nStochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) is further incorporated\nto improve model generalizability.\n4.2.1. P ROBLEM DEFINITION\nWhile fine-tuning the CLIP model yields impressive results\nfor close-set video classification (Wang et al., 2021; Ni et al.,\n2022), its performance on unseen categories is poor\u2014might\nbe worse than the original CLIP model as shown in Table 4.\nBelow, we elaborate on how to construct a robust open-\nvocabulary video model from a pretrained CLIP model.\nFormally, our goal is to obtain the optimal vision encoder\nf\u03b8Uthat satisfies:\n\u03b8U= arg min\n\u03b8L(\u03b8;DU). (4)\nHere, DU={VU,TU}is ahypothetical universal dataset\nthat contains all possible videos and their corresponding\n3 Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\ntext descriptions ( i.e., action labels). Lis the loss function\ndefined on the video-text pairs. Optimizing such an objec-\ntive directly is infeasible, yet luckily it can be approximated\nby training on a large-scale dataset with sufficiently diverse\nvideo and text data.\n4.2.2. A NAPPROXIMATION EQUIVALENT TO\nCONTINUAL LEARNING\nWe first consider a video action recognition dataset DB=\n{VB,TB}used for fine-tuning. Unfortunately, even though\nthe abundant video data VBserve as a good approximation\nofVU, its text space is extremely limited, bounded by the\nnumber of annotated action categories ( e.g.,|TB|= 400\nfor Kinetics-400 (Kay et al., 2017)). As a result, the video\nrepresentation is prone to overfitting to the highly skewed\ntext space and the zero-shot ability of the CLIP model di-\nminishes over the fine-tuning process. On the other hand,\nthe scale of the image training dataset for CLIP, is suffi-\nciently large to approximate DU, but there exists a domain\ngap between the image space and the video space. Even\nworse, this dataset is a private dataset and only the CLIP\nmodel weights \u03b8Aare accessible for fine-tuning.\nWith these pros and cons in mind, we now seek to lever-\nageboth\u03b8AandDBto construct a strong open-vocabulary\nmodel. We believe that \u03b8Ashould contain useful informa-\ntion from the large image dataset that CLIP was originally\ntrained on. Following this intuition, we notice that the initial\nVCLIP model (without any fine-tuning) \u03b8Ais indeed an\noptimal solution to a large-scale video dataset DAwith a\nsufficiently diverse text space TA(Lemma 4.1).\nLemma 4.1. Suppose the image CLIP model was trained\non an image-text dataset D\u00afA={I\u00afA,T\u00afA}with Nex-\namples. Then, there exists a diverse video-text dataset\nDA={VA,TA}containing Nexamples where the video\nCLIP model with original CLIP parameters \u03b8Ais optimal.\nProof. See Appendix.\nAlthough DAis unknown, it is helpful to understand our\nproblem. Given the fact that \u03b8Ais an optimal solution in\na large scale dataset DA, a natural idea for approximating\nthe universal objective is to combine both datasets in the\nderivation, although DAis unknown in reality.\nFollowing this idea, Equation (4) is transformed into:\narg min\n\u03b8L(\u03b8;DA) +L(\u03b8;DB) (5)\nwhere DAis completely unknown and only DBis present.\nHowever, we have the optimal solution \u03b8AonDA. In that\ncase, the formulation becomes equivalent to continual learn-\ning,i.e., continually training the model on a new dataset\nwhile preserving its performance on historical data so as to\nachieve sufficient generalizability.4.2.3. I NTERPOLATED WEIGHT REGULARIZATION\nWhile there have been many methods of studying continual\nlearning, most of them are based on storing historical data\nor information, which is not applicable in our case. It is due\nto the fact that we do not have access to DAat all. Inspired\nby empirical results in (Ilharco et al., 2022), we propose to\nlowing the first loss term in Equation (5) by introducing an\noptimization-free weight interpolation strategy:\n\u03b8=\u03bb\u03b8A+ (1\u2212\u03bb)\u03b8B, (6)\nwhere \u03bbis a trade-off hyperparameter. Equation (6) is called\nmodel patching (Ilharco et al., 2022), which is commonly\nused between two converged model weights, i.e.,\u03b8Bis\ntrained separately on DBonly. A potential risk of this\nmethod is that we have no explicit optimization on the curve\nfitting performance of the final patched model, i.e., the patch\nmay be severely underfitting to DBor sensitive to the trade-\noff parameter \u03bb.\nTo address this issue, we propose Interpolated Weight Reg-\nularization as part of the training procedure, which regu-\nlarizes the loss of the interpolated weights on DB. Given\nthat the \u03bbis a hyperparameter that may vary, instead of opti-\nmizing a single point, we look for a solution such that the\npatched model\u2019s performance w.r.t. a range of interpolation\ncoefficients are optimized. This is achieved by sampling a\nbalancing coefficient during training. The final optimization\nobjective becomes:\narg min\n\u03b8BL=L(\u03b8B;DB) +\u03b2L(\u03b1\u03b8A+ (1\u2212\u03b1)\u03b8B;DB)\n(7)\nwhere \u03b1\u223cU(0, \u03bb). The (0, \u03bb)interval corresponds to the\nlow-level region between the interpolated and end weights.\n\u03b2is the trade-off coefficient for regularization and it is set as\n\u03b2=C1\n1\u2212\u03b1in practice where Cis a constant value. The loss\ncan be optimized by calculating its derivative as follows:\ndL\nd\u03b8=dL\nd\u03b8\f\f\f\f\n\u03b8=\u03b8B+\u03b2(1\u2212\u03b1)dL\nd\u03b8\f\f\f\f\n\u03b8=\u03b1\u03b8A+(1\u2212\u03b1)\u03b8B(8)\n=dL\nd\u03b8\f\f\f\f\n\u03b8=\u03b8B+CdL\nd\u03b8\f\f\f\f\n\u03b8=\u03b1\u03b8A+(1\u2212\u03b1)\u03b8B. (9)\nAfter we obtain the optimal \u03b8B, Equation (6) is applied to\nachieve the final VCLIP model weights.\n4.2.4. S TOCHASTIC WEIGHT AVERAGING\nImproved zero-shot predicting ability lies in good general-\nization ability. We further introduce an upgrade to the above\nmethod by applying Stochastic Weight Average (SWA) on\nthe interpolated weights along the training process to find\nthe \u201cflat minimum\u201d, which refer to a region in the weight\nspace where the loss function is relatively flat and the test\nerror is relatively low according to (Izmailov et al., 2018).\n4 Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\nEquation (10) showcases our solution:\nNX\ni\u03bb\u03b8A+ (1\u2212\u03bb)\u03b8i\nN=\u03bb\u03b8A+ (1\u2212\u03bb)1\nNNX\ni\u03b8i(10)\nwhere \u03b8irefers to the i-th set of parameters we select during\nthe training process. As Equation (10) shows, the moving\naverage of the interpolated weights equals to interpolat-\ning the moving average of the updated weights, showing\nthe order of the SWA and the weight interpolation is inter-\nchangable. So, in practice, we maintain the moving average\nof the model\u2019s weights during training and do weight inter-\npolation in the end. By averaging model weights from the\noptimization trajectories, we will get a robust model with\nbetter generalization to unseen classes.\n4.3.

Experiments\nWe present in this section our experimental evaluation. We\ncompare our Open-VCLIP method with state-of-the-artvideo models and perform ablation studies to reveal the\ncharacteristics of our method.\n5.1. Experimental Setup\n5.1.1. D ATASETS\nIn our experiments, we use the following four datasets:\nKinetics-400&600: Kinetics-400 (Kay et al., 2017) and\nKinetics-600 (Carreira et al., 2018) datasets are large-scale\ndatasets for human action recognition, containing 400 and\n600 action classes, respectively. The Kinetics-600 dataset is\nan extension of the Kinetics-400 dataset, including 220 new\ncategories. These additional classes provide a valuable re-\nsource for evaluating the zero-shot ability of models trained\non the Kinetics-400. Each video is a 10-second around\naction moment annotated from YouTube videos.\nUCF-101: The UCF-101 dataset (Soomro et al., 2012) is\na widely used dataset for human action recognition, which\ncontains 13,320 video clips from 101 action categories.\nEach video in the dataset is a short clip of an action, with an\naverage length of 7.21 seconds, that is captured from real-\nworld scenarios. Officially, three different training/testing\nsplits files are provided.\nHMDB-51: HMDB-51 (Kuehne et al., 2011) contains 6,849\nclips divided into 51 action categories with each category\ncontaining at least 101 clips. Officially, three different train-\ning/testing splits are provided to evaluate the model. To\nensure a balance in the number of samples per category,\n1,746 videos are left \u201cunused\u201d in each split, while each cate-\ngory is guaranteed to have 70 training samples and 30 test\nsamples. Having a consistent number of testing samples for\neach category allows for a fair evaluation.\nWe use the Kinetics-400 dataset as the training set and use\nUCF-101, HMDB-51, and a subset of the Kinetics-600\ndataset as test datasets. By testing on datasets that contain\nno/few overlapping categories with the training dataset, we\nare able to provide a realistic and comprehensive evaluation\nof the zero-shot capabilities. Detailed evaluation protocols\nare described below.\n5.1.2. E VALUATION PROTOCOLS\nUCF-101&HMDB-51: Following (Brattoli et al., 2020)\nand (Ni et al., 2022), there are three protocols for zero-shot\nevaluation on these two datasets.\n\u2022Evaluation Protocol 1 ( EP1): We first randomly choose\nhalf of the classes in the test dataset, i.e., 50 for UCF\nand 25 for HMDB, and repeat ten times and report\naveraged results for each dataset. (Brattoli et al., 2020)\n\u2022Evaluation Protocol 2 ( EP2): We test the model on\nfull UCF and HMDB, i.e., evaluating on all 101 UCF\nclasses and all 51 HMDB classes (Brattoli et al., 2020).\n5 Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\nTable 1.

The average top-1 accuracy and\nstandard deviation are reported.\nKinetics-600: (Chen & Huang, 2021) randomly split 220\nnew classes in Kinetics-600 into 60 validation classes and\n160 testing classes, respectively, three times. We use the\nsame splits provided by (Chen & Huang, 2021). We report\nthe average top-1 accuracy as well as the standard deviation.\n5.1.3. I MPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nThe initial learning rate is set to 3.33\u00d710\u22126and is decayed\nto3.33\u00d710\u22128following the cosine decay scheduler. We\nuse 2 epochs to warm up the training and another 20 epochs\nfor fine-tuning on Kinetics-400. Th learning rate for warm-\nup is set to 3.33\u00d710\u22128and we use 8 GPUs for training,\neach contains a batch of 8 samples. Since we are performing\nvision-text alignment during the training process, augmen-\ntations such as mixup and cutmix significantly impact the\nalignment process. Therefore, we do not use them to avoid\nany potential negative effects for alignment. Instead, we\nsimply use basic augmentations like color jittering, random\nflipping, and random cropping. Each video clip is extracted\nevery 16 frames for a total of 8 frames to form an input video\nclip. During testing, 3 clips with 1 crop (\u201c 3\u00d71views\u201d)\nper video will be sampled to produce a prediction and the\nresults will be further aggregated linearly. Furthermore, we\nset the interval of regularization to (0.0, 0.6), the balance\nratioCof the regularization is set to 0.5, and we start SWA\nfrom the second epoch when the warm-up stage finishes.5.2. Main Results\n5.2.1. C OMPARISON TO STATE -OF-THE-ARTS\nWe compare our method to state-of-the-art zero-shot video\naction recognition methods using the UCF-101, HMDB-51,\nand a subset of Kinetics-600 datasets for evaluation. We\nfirst present the results under Evaluation Protocol 1 and\nEvaluation Protocol 2 , summarized in Table 1. The first\nblock of Table 1 presents methods that do not rely on large-\nscale vision-language pretrained models, while the last two\nblocks of Table 1 show the performance of CLIP-based\nmethods that transfer the image CLIP model to the video\ndomain by fine-tuning on the Kinetics-400 dataset.\nAs shown in the table, the results of CLIP-based methods,\ni.e.ActionCLIP, TEXT3VIS, and ours, are significantly bet-\nter than other methods. This indicates that knowledge from\nlarge-scale vision-language pretrained models is important\nfor zero-shot video action recognition performance. Fur-\nthermore, when using the ViT-B/16 encoder, our method\noutperforms ActionCLIP by 14% (83.5% vs 69.5%) and\n2.7% (53.2% vs 50.5%); when using the ViT-L/14 encoder,\nour method outperforms TEXT4VIS by 8.3% (87.9% vs\n79.6%) and 8.5% (58.3% vs 49.8%). These substantial\nimprovements in accuracy highlight that our approach can\neffectively adapt the CLIP model to the video domain for\nimproved zero-shot recognition. We also compare with X-\nCLIP (Ni et al., 2022) under Evaluation Protocol 3 on UCF\nand HMDB datasets. Results in Table 2 reveal that Open-\nVCLIP outperforms X-CLIP by 11.4% (83.4% vs 72.0%)\non UCF and 9.3% (53.9% vs 44.6%) on HMDB using ViT-\nB/16, suggesting the effectiveness of our approach.\nAs for Kinetics-600 dataset, as shown in Table 3, we see that\nour method also performs favorably, especially compared to\nX-CLIP (Ni et al., 2022) and TEXT4VIS (Wu et al., 2023).\n6 Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\nTable 2.

R ESULTS WITH DIFFERENT BACKBONES\nWe compare Open-VCLIP with the CLIP baseline and stan-\ndard fine-tuning using various backbone networks. In par-\nticular, the results in the \u201cCLIP\u2217\u201d column of Table 4 show\nthe performance of the pretrained CLIP model, which pre-\ndicts each image frame of the video seperately. The \u201cFINE-\nTUNE\u201d column shows the results of a standard fine-tuning\nprocess using the same model as Open-VCLIP. We see\nfrom Table 4 that larger backbone networks (ViT-L/14 >\nViT-B/16 >ViT-B/32) consistently improve zero-shot per-\nformance. For example, the results in the \u201cCLIP\u2217\u201d columnshow that the ViT-L/14 model outperforms the ViT-B/16 by\n6.3% (80.5% vs 74.2%), 7.4% (55.0% vs 47.6%), and 8.1%\n(76.2% vs 68.1%) on the UCF, HMDB, and Kinetics-600\ndatasets, respectively, while similar trends can be found in\nthe last two columns of Table 4, demonstrating that larger-\nscale vision-language pretrained models contain stronger\nzero-shot knowledge and are more robust when transferred\nfrom image to video tasks. However, as we can see from\nthe results of \u201cFINE-TUNE\u201d and \u201cCLIP\u2217\u201d in Table 4, the\nfine-tuning process does not always result in improved per-\nformance. For example, the fine-tuning process leads to\nworse zero-shot results on the HMDB dataset when using\nthe ViT-L/14 backbone, and all zero-shot testing results on\nthe Kinetics-600 show a performance drop after models are\nfine-tuned on Kinetics-400 under a standard paradigm. The\nresults indicate that the knowledge stored in CLIP cannot\nalways be transferred with conventional fine-tuning.\nCompared to the baselines, our approach demonstrates sig-\nnificant and consistent improvements in zero-shot video\naction recognition across various datasets and models, as\nshown in the last column of Table 4. Taking experimental\nresults on Kinetics-600 as an example, our approach not\nonly avoids the performance drop seen in the \u201cFINE-TUNE\u201d\nmethod, but also significantly improves zero-shot recogni-\ntion. This highlights the effectiveness of our method in ef-\nfectively using annotated video datasets with limited labels\nfor transfer learning and effectively preventing knowledge\nfrom forgetting, offering stable and decent results.\n5.3. Discussion and Ablation Studies\nThe effectiveness of temporal modeling and weight inter-\npolation. We also investigate whether temporal modeling is\nneeded for transferring CLIP to the video domain. To this\nend, we compare the performance of the CLIP, VCLIP, and\nOpen-VCLIP, represented by green, blue and red curves in\nFigure 2, respectively. In particular, VCLIP expands the\noriginal spatial attention of CLIP to spatial-temporal atten-\ntion without additional parameters as in Open-VCLIP. The\ncurves illustrate weight interpolations with different mixing\ncoefficients between CLIP and the fine-tuned model. Con-\ncretely, the y-axis displays the accuracy on the zero-shot\nvideo dataset, while the x-axis displays accuracy on the\nfine-tunning dataset, Kinetics-400.\nComparing the tails of the green and blue curves, we see\nthat VCLIP achieves not only better close-set performance,\nbut also better zero-shot performance on all of the three\ndatasets. At the same time, when applying weight interpola-\ntion with different ratios, VCLIP achieves better trade-off\nthan CLIP, as evidenced by the fact that the blue curve is\nalways on top of the green curve in Figure 2. This strongly\nsuggests the significant advantages that come with incorpo-\nrating temporal modeling in the context of zero-shot video\naction recognition.\n7 Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\nFigure 2. We evaluate the effectiveness of temporal modeling and weight interpolation with a VCLIP B/16 model. Points on each curve\nrepresent interpolation ratios of 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.0 from left to right, respectively. The red star marks correspond to our\nreported main results. We test on the full UCF, HMDB and the first split in (Chen & Huang, 2021) on Kinetics-600.\nFigure 3. We evaluate the effectiveness of IWR and SWA with a VCLIP B/16 on the full UCF, HMDB and the first split in (Chen &\nHuang, 2021) on Kinetics-600.\nFigure 4. We compare Open-VCLIP with an \u21132regularization imposed on weigths on the full UCF, HMDB and the first split in (Chen &\nHuang, 2021) on Kinetics-600.\nFurthermore, the clear margins observed between the red\ncurves and the other curves in Figure 2 show that our pro-\nposed solution achieves the best trade-off compared to pure\nfine-tuning. With the same-level of close-set results, our\napproach always produces better zero-shot accuracy. In ad-\ndition, the star marks on the red curves, which correspond to\nthe reported main results in Tables 1 to 3, are always better\nthan the other baseline curves.\nIWR v.s.SWA. Our approach is composed of two weight\ninterpolation modules: IWR which is used during training\nto regularize the fine-tuning process and SWA to improve\ngeneralization. We investigate their contributions to the\nfinal results in Figure 3. Overall, removing either IWR\n(green curve) or SWA (yellow curve) from the model leads\nto significant drops, i.e.the red curve outperforms all other\ncurves, suggesting IWR and SWA are complimentary to\neach other. Furthermore, we see using only IWR or SWA isable to produce a good zero-shot performance improvement,\ncompared to the results with no interpolation at all.\nWeight regularization during fine-tuning. IWR is con-\nceptually similar to EWC (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017), which\npenalizes the changes of important parameters for solving\nprevious tasks. However, EWC needs to assess the impor-\ntance of parameters through historical data which is not\nfeasible to our setting. Instead, we simply constrain the\noptimization by penalizing the weight changes using an \u21132\nnorm. Concretely, we use the \u21132distance between the up-\ndated weights and the original weights as the regularization\nloss term during training, assigning various weights to the\nregularization loss term. As shown in Figure 4, our method\nachieves the best trade-off. Open-VCLIP achieves higher\nclose-set and zero-shot accuracy across all the datasets com-\npared with simply applying an \u21132normalization, demon-\nstrating the effectiveness of Open-VCLIP.\n8 Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model\nTable 5.

As-\nsessing the model via text-to-video/video-to-text retrieval\ntasks offers insight into its generalizability within the video\ndomain. We follow the paradigm of training models\non Kinetics-400 dataset and testing them on MSR-VTT\ndataset (Xu et al., 2016), which is a large video description\ndataset. We firstly report the result of our own implemen-\ntation using CLIP for retrieval as shown in the third row\nof Table 5, which is similar to the results in (Portillo et al.,\n2021). This guarantees fair comparisons. Then, we evaluate\nOpen-VCLIP on MSR-VTT. We find that our text-to-video\nretrieval (given a text to retrieve the corresponding video)\nrecall is comparable to that of raw CLIP but with a much\nhigher close-set score on K400 (78.9% vs 57.5%). Further\nincreasing the mixing coefficient \u03bbimproves the text-to-\nvideo retrieval performance of Open-VCLIP, surpassing the\nCLIP baseline by 2%. We also show that the video-to-text\nretrieval (given a video to retrieve the corresponding text)\nperformance of Open-VCLIP is significantly higher than\nthat of the CLIP baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness\nof our method in preserving the alignment capability when\ntransferring to video domains.\nComparison with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Fine-\ntuning only a part of the weights of a network is an ef-\nfective approach for adapting the CLIP model to video in\na parameter-efficient manner. A noteworthy method that\nemploys this strategy is the ST-Adapter (Pan et al., 2022),\nwhich accomplishes effective video classification by training\nadded adapter modules, while keeping the original param-\neters of the CLIP model frozen. We compare ST-Adapter\nwith our approach. More specifically, ST-Adapter forgoes\nthe text encoder of CLIP, while introducing an additional\nlinear classifier instead. This change prevents the model\nfrom being used in zero-shot testing. To circumvent this\nproblem, we incorporate the text encoder of CLIP into our\nimplementation of the ST-Adapter. The results presented\nin Table 6 illustrates that the ST-Adapter, while preserving\nthe original CLIP weights and only fine-tuning the added\nadapters, fails to match the performance of our proposed\nmethod in zero-shot action recognition. In particular, we\nobserve a marked degradation in the zero-shot performance\nof the ST-Adapter on the K600 dataset, suggesting thatparameter-efficient fine-tuning does not effectively address\nthe issue of catastrophic forgetting.\nTable 6.

Conclusion\nWe presented Open-VCLIP, an effective approach that en-\nables CLIP to be transformed to an open-vocabulary video\nmodel. Open-VCLIP contains lightweight temporal mod-\neling modules that equip CLIP with the ability to capture\nspatial and temporal relationships in videos. More impor-\ntantly, Open-VCLIP is optimized with a carefully designed\nregularization strategy that strives for generalization to pre-\nserve the zero-shot abilities of CLIP. Extensive experiments\nare conducted and the results demonstrate that Open-VCLIP\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods with clear margins\non zero-shot video action recognition and achieves the best\ntrade-off between close-set and zero-shot video action recog-\nnition. One potential limitation is that adversaries could\ncraft membership inference attacks to steal information from\nthe model.\nAcknowledgements\nThis project was supported by NSFC under Grant No.\n62032006 and No. 62102092.

Examples of human gestures include hand\nwaving and head nodding. On the other hand, human action\nencompasses longer-duration movements involving more body\nparts. A sequence comprising multiple actions is referred to\nas human activity. Finally, human interaction contains human\ninteractions with the surrounding environment, including both\nhuman-to-human and human-to-object interactions. The pres-\nence of multiple humans or interactions with various objects\nincreases the complexity of motion analysis, which can further\nbe complicated by online or of\ufb02ine human behavior analysis.\nIn the past, capturing human actions through human-\nperformance systems often necessitated the application of\nmarkers on the subjects\u2019 bodies and the use of distinctive\nattire. Despite overcoming these limitations, the high cost of\ncameras remained a hindrance to widespread adoption [3].\nHowever, recent advancements have led to the development of\ncost-effective contactless sensing devices, such as Microsoft\nKinect, Intel Realsense, and Doppler radar. Historically, the\nRGB modality in human action capture has been challenged by\nvarious factors, including illumination, occlusions, background\nclutter, frame rate, viewpoint, and biometric variations. By\ncontrast, RGB-D sensors have mitigated some of these dif-\n\ufb01culties, particularly with regard to illumination, and provide\na crucial advantage by enabling the generation of 3D structural\ninformation of the scene. As a result, estimating 3D human\nskeleton joints has become a relatively straightforward process\nin the RGB-D modality.\nFor many years, machine learning algorithms have been the\nprimary technologies incorporated to address various computer\nvision problems, including action recognition. The conven-\ntional approach to human motion analysis involves capturing\nand representing spatiotemporal information, which enhances\nthe accuracy and robustness of the analysis. Typically, features\nare extracted manually and incorporated into classical machine\nlearning algorithms to perform different tasks. The research\ncommunity has explored various features representations, in-\ncluding joint coordinates [4], the center of gravity [5], the\nangle between skeleton joints [6], motion velocity [7], and\narXiv:2301.13360v1  [cs.CV]  31 Jan 2023\n co-occurrence features [8]. The selection of the appropriate\nalgorithm also recreates a vital role in the machine learning\nera. Many algorithms have been utilized, including Support\nVector Machine (SVM) [9], Linear Discriminant Analysis\n(LDA) [10], Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor [11], Logistic\nRegression [12], and KNN [13]. However, the generalization\nof machine learning algorithms is challenging and requires\nsigni\ufb01cant effort in feature engineering.\nRecent advancements in deep learning-based techniques\nhave demonstrated superior performance in various computer\nvision problems, such as image classi\ufb01cation [1], object de-\ntection [2], action recognition [14], and action detection [15].\nThe increasing interest in skeleton-based representation has\nbeen driven by the abundant and discriminative features that\ncan be derived from skeleton joints. For instance, features\nsuch as Skeleton Map [16], Joint Trajectory Map [17], Joint\nDistance Map [18], and many others can be extracted from the\nskeleton joint data alone. Consequently, the utilization of deep-\nlearning algorithms has emerged as a prevalent approach for\nskeleton-based human action recognition. Our contributions\nare summarized as follows:\n\u2022 Construct an easy-to-integrate and modular Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) for the action recognition task,\nwhich attains results comparable to the State-of-the-Art\n(SOTA) methods.\n\u2022 Despite the prevalence of graph neural network-based\nmethods in the SOTA contributions to the action recogni-\ntion task, we demonstrate that CNNs can attain compara-\nble results by implementing various training techniques.\n\u2022 Our results indicate that incorporating a diverse set of\naugmentation techniques leads to an improvement in the\ngeneralization and robustness of the model.\n\u2022 Our \ufb01ndings reveal that utilizing a margin-based cosine\nloss function instead of the conventional cross-entropy\nloss leads to a signi\ufb01cant enhancement in performance.\nII. RELATED WORK\nDeep-learning approaches have been demonstrated superi-\nority over conventional machine learning algorithms in vari-\nous computer vision tasks, including image classi\ufb01cation as\ndemonstrated in [1] in the ImageNet dataset, object detection\nas introduced by Ren et al. [2] with their Faster R-CNN\nframework, action recognition as recently revisited by Duan\net al [14], and action detection as proposed by Wang et\nal. [15]. In recent years, skeleton-based representations have\ngarnered increasing attention due to the wealth of rich and\ndiscriminative features that can be obtained from the skeleton\njoints. Examples of such representations include the Skeleton\nMap [16], Joint Trajectory Map [17], Joint Distance Map\n[18], among others, all of which are based solely on features\nextracted from the skeleton joints data.\n1) Convolution Neural Network - CNN Approaches:\nWang et al. [17] proposed the Joint Trajectory Map (JTM),\na representation that captures the spatiotemporal information\nof a sequence in the form of 2D images. This work emphasizes\nhuman motion magnitude and speed as the core features, rep-\nresented by the saturation value in the HSV (Hue-Saturation-\nValue) color space, with higher motion magnitude and speed\nyielding a higher saturation value. Du et al. [16] introduced\na method for encoding the spatiotemporal features of an\naction sequence into an image matrix. This representation is\nconstructed by vertically encoding the skeleton\u2019s joint coor-\ndinates into the RGB channels and horizontally encoding the\nsequence frames. The encoded information is then quanti\ufb01ed,\nnormalized, and transformed into an image for use with a\nCNN classi\ufb01cation network. In addition to the skeleton map\nrepresentation proposed by Du et al., Li et al. [19] proposed\na two-stream CNN-based network that leverages the skeleton\nmap. Li et al. [18] extracted discriminative features from the\npair-wise distances between skeleton joints in a human action\nsequence to construct a Joint Distance Map (JDM), which\nmaps the skeleton sequence into images. Bilinear interpolation\nwas applied to address the issue of variable sequence duration.\nLi et al. [8] embarked on the problem of joint co-occurrence\nby proposing an end-to-end hierarchical framework that fa-\ncilitates better feature learning, gradually aggregating point-\nlevel features into global co-occurrence features. Ke et al. [20]\nproposed a translation, scale, and rotation invariant body part\nvector-based representation, using geometrical features of the\nskeleton to generate two sets of features: cosine distance and\nnormalized magnitude. The human skeleton joints are grouped\ninto \ufb01ve parts: trunk, right arm, left arm, right leg, and left leg.\nBoth cosine distance and normalized magnitude features are\ncomputed within the body and skeleton, yielding ten feature\nvectors fed into a CNN for further feature extraction and\ntraining.\n2) Recurrent Neural Network - RNN Approaches: The\nrecognition of human actions is a problem of spatiotempo-\nral representation. To capture the discriminative features, re-\nsearchers have proposed utilizing conventional RNN networks.\nYet, the vanishing gradient problem has necessitated adapting\nmemory gating techniques, such as long-short term memory\n(LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). To address this issue,\nDu et al. [21] proposed a hierarchical bidirectional recurrent\nneural network (BRNN) that models the long-term temporal\nsequence through an end-to-end approach. To facilitate better\nfeature representation, the human body is divided into \ufb01ve\nparts and processed through \ufb01ve different BRNN subnets.\nThe outputs are fused and classi\ufb01ed in higher layers before\nbeing fed into the \ufb01nal BRNN. To further improve the sys-\ntem\u2019s robustness, Du et al. [22] implemented random rotation\ntransformation during preprocessing and scale transformation\nto account for varying human sizes. Salient motion patterns\nhave been leveraged as essential features in various human\naction-related tasks. However, LSTM struggles to capture\nthe spatiotemporal dynamics. To resolve this, Veeriah et al.\n[23] proposed a differential gating for LSTM-RNN networks\nthat quanti\ufb01es the salient motion between frames through the\nderivative of state (DoS). Skeleton-based action recognition\npresents several challenges, including the intra-frame joint\nspatiotemporal information of all frames in a sequence. To\n address these challenges, Sogn et al. [24] proposed an end-\nto-end spatiotemporal attention model that adaptively learns\nintra-frame and inter-frame dependencies through recurrent\nRNN and LSTM. Human skeleton data contains discriminative\nfeatures such as acceleration, angles, spatial coordinates, orien-\ntation, and velocity. Zhang et al. [25] evaluated eight geometric\nfeatures on a 3-layer LSTM network and found that computing\nthe distance between joints and selected lines outperformed the\nother features.\n3) Graph Convolution Network - GCN Approaches:\nYan et al. [26] introduced the initial spatiotemporal graph\nconvolutional network (ST-GCN), which established edges\nbetween joints in both the intra-frame and inter-frame dimen-\nsions. Typically, in graph-based techniques, the convolution\noperation is performed over the neighboring joints within the\nreceptive \ufb01eld. However, conducting a convolution over non-\nEuclidean data necessitates a judicious partition strategy to\nattain a label map. Although ST-GCN [26] achieved substantial\nresults in the human action recognition task, it faced several\nlimitations. The graph representation in ST-GCN was created\nbased on the human body\u2019s physical structure, which may not\nbe ideal for characterizing human action. For example, in an\nact like clapping, the relationship between the hands is crucial\nin classifying the action. In this case, ST-GCN fails to capture\nsuch a relationship since the two hands are not connected and\nare distant from each other in the kinematic tree. Additionally,\ncertain geometric features, such as bone orientation and length,\nare challenging to represent in graph-based algorithms. To\novercome these limitations, Shi et al. [27] proposed an end-\nto-end data-driven multi-stream attention-enhanced adaptive\ngraph convolutional network (MS-AAGCN), where the graph\ntopology is learned and generated adaptively from the input\ndata. In practical scenarios, occlusion is a prevalent challenge\nthat is often unavoidable. Song et al. [28] proposed a GCN-\nbased model that is trained on incomplete spatiotemporal\nskeleton data, with intra-frame joints and inter-frame frames\nmasked to imitate occlusion effects. Moreover, Yoon et al.\n[29] incorporated noise into the skeleton data to enhance the\nmodel\u2019s robustness.\nIII. DATA PREPROCESSING\nTypically, skeleton data is represented in a camera coordi-\nnate system, leading to a diverse representation of captured\nsequences from different viewpoints, as illustrated in Figures\n3 (A), (B), and (C). To mitigate the impact of view variation,\na common approach is to transform the skeleton data into a\nuni\ufb01ed coordinate system [30]\u2013[33]. This is typically accom-\nplished through a sequence of geometric translation, rotation,\nand normalization operations, as depicted in Figures 3 (D), (E),\nand (F). There are various transformation strategies presented\nin the literature. In frame-based approaches, the transformation\noperation is applied to each frame in the sequence, which,\nhowever, results in the loss of some relative motions. For\nexample, when applied to the walking action, this technique\nproduces an effect as if walking on a treadmill. On the\nother hand, in sequence-based strategies, the \ufb01rst frame in\nthe sequence is designated as the reference frame, and all\ntransformations applied to the subsequent frames are relative\nto this reference frame. This approach provides a more realistic\nrepresentation of human skeleton motions.\nFig. 1.\nAction representation from NTU-D 60 dataset A) -45\u00b0skeleton\nvisualization, B) 0 \u00b0skeleton visualization, C) 45\u00b0skeleton visualization. (D,\nE, F) are the transformed skeleton for the same skeletons in (A, B, C)\nA. Encoding Skeleton to Image\nGiven a sequence of skeletons S, where s \u2208(1, ..., S), and\nthe jth joint in the tth frame of skeleton s is represented\nas st,j = [xt,j, yt,j, zt,j], with j \u2208(1, ..., J) denoting the\nnumber of joints in a frame and t \u2208(1, ..., T) denoting the\ntotal number of frames in the sequence S.\nInspired by the work of Du et al. [16], we transform the raw\nskeleton data into a skeleton map image that preserves spa-\ntiotemporal information, as depicted in Fig. 2. Given an RGB\nimage of dimensions [H, W, C], where H represents height,\nW represents width, and C represents the conventional RGB\nimage channels, we map the action sequence S, represented\nin the dimension of T \u00d7 N \u00d7 3, to an image of dimensions\n[H, W, C]. Here, T represents the number of frames and maps\nto the height of the image, N represents the number of joints\nand maps to the width of the image, and the last dimension\nrepresents the 3D joint coordinates of the joints in a frame,\nwhich are mapped to the three channels of the image.\nSince raw skeleton data may have different value ranges\nthan the image, pixel normalization is necessary to ensure\nthat the mapped values are in the range of 0 \u2212255. This is\naccomplished by:\nPt,j = floor(255 \u00d7\nst,j \u2212Cmin\nCmax \u2212Cmin\n)\n(1)\nIV. DATA AUGMENTATION\nData augmentation is a well-established technique utilized\nto enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms\nby diversifying the training data. This approach involves syn-\nthesizing new samples from the existing training data by em-\nploying transformations such as scaling, rotation, translation,\nand other deformations. Adding these transformed samples to\nthe training set can improve the generalization performance\nof the machine learning algorithm, making it more resilient\n Fig. 2. The pipeline of generating the skeleton map image\nto variations in the input data. Data augmentation is widely\napplied across several deep-learning tasks, including image\nclassi\ufb01cation, object detection, and natural language process-\ning.\nOn the other hand, Skeleton-based data augmentation is\nused explicitly for tasks involving 3D pose information, such\nas 3D human pose estimation. This approach involves trans-\nforming the 3D joint positions of a skeleton to generate new\npose samples. Image-based data augmentation is utilized for\ntasks where the input data consists of images, including image\nclassi\ufb01cation and object detection.\nIn this research, we investigated various image-based and\nskeleton-based techniques for data augmentation, as outlined\nin TABLE. Our approach is inspired by RandAugmentation\n[34], which randomly injects the training pipeline with prede-\n\ufb01ned augmentations based on the number and magnitude of\naugmentations to be applied.\nThe Flipping Sequence augmentation technique, as de-\nscribed in [35], involves the generation of synthetic pose\nsequences by horizontally \ufb02ipping the input pose sequences.\nThis is achieved through the re\ufb02ection of the 3D joint positions\nacross a horizontal plane when applied to skeleton data and\nby \ufb02ipping in both the horizontal and vertical planes when\napplied to image data. As a result, a new pose sequence with\nactions performed in the opposite direction is produced.\nThe Geometric Rotation augmentation, as discussed in\n[34], generates new synthetic samples by applying random\nrotations to the input data. This is achieved by rotating the\ninput images or 3D objects around a \ufb01xed point, utilizing a\nspeci\ufb01ed angle and center of rotation.\nThe Cutout augmentation, as presented in [36], is a regu-\nlarization technique utilized in deep learning. This technique\ninvolves randomly masking a portion of an image during\nthe training process, which necessitates the model to learn\nto ignore these regions and focus on the remaining parts.\nThis can enhance the model\u2019s generalization to new data, thus\nimproving its performance. Cutout augmentation is frequently\nadopted in image classi\ufb01cation tasks, where it can aid the\nmodel in recognizing objects in images, despite variations in\ntheir appearance. It can be easily implemented in most deep\nlearning frameworks as a simple and effective regularization\nmethod for deep learning models.\nThe Zoom augmentation, as described in [34], involves\nrescaling the input images or 3D objects using a speci\ufb01ed\nzoom factor, which determines the extent of the zooming.\nThis augmentation method is appropriate for both image\nand skeleton data. Additionally, the Shear augmentation, as\ndiscussed in Cubuk et al. (2020) [34], is achieved through\nthe utilization of a linear transformation that maps the x-\naxis or y-axis coordinates of the input data to new positions.\nThe Translate augmentation, also presented in Cubuk et al.\n(2020) [34], involves the shifting of the x-axis, y-axis, or both\ncoordinates of the input data by a speci\ufb01ed amount.\nThe introduction of various types of noise to image data\nduring training has been demonstrated to enhance the gen-\neralizability and robustness of machine learning models [37].\nSalt-and-Pepper noise [38] is a form of noise that mimics the\neffect of corrupted or missing pixels in the input data. This is\nachieved by randomly setting a speci\ufb01ed proportion of pixels\nto either the minimum or maximum intensity value, creating\nthe appearance of salt and pepper grains on the image. The\nremaining pixels remain unaltered.\nAnother noise-based augmentation strategy is Localvars\nnoise [37]. This method generates random noise samples from\na speci\ufb01ed distribution. Speckle noise [37] generates random\nnoise samples from a Poisson distribution with a speci\ufb01ed\nmean. In contrast, Gaussian noise [37] generates random noise\nsamples from a Gaussian distribution with a speci\ufb01ed mean\nand standard deviation.\nIn the context of skeleton data, Bone Shuf\ufb02ing augmenta-\ntion is applied. This is achieved by randomly permuting the\n3D joint positions of the skeleton, resulting in a new pose\nsequence in which a different body con\ufb01guration performs the\nsame actions. Additionally, Bone Masking augmentation is\nimplemented by setting the 3D joint positions of the skeleton\nto zero for a randomly selected subset of bones. A similar\ntechnique can also be applied on the frame level rather than\nthe bone level.\nFig. 3. Various augmentation implementation\n V. LOSS FUNCTION\nIn the realm of Deep Learning, a loss function serves\nas an evaluation metric of a model\u2019s ability to predict the\ndesired outcome. The objective of training a model is to\n\ufb01nd the optimal set of parameters that minimize the loss\nfunction, leading to the model\u2019s improved accuracy in making\npredictions on unseen data. The use of classi\ufb01cation loss is\nprevalent in classifying outputs into discrete class labels. The\nCross-Entropy loss is a popular choice for action recogni-\ntion classi\ufb01cation problems [39]. Although the Cross-Entropy\nloss often proves effective in training models, it has certain\nlimitations, including sensitivity to the relative magnitude of\npredicted and true values, rendering it challenging to use in\nspeci\ufb01c scenarios.\nOne critical observation when utilizing the Cross-Entropy\nloss function is that the distance between samples of different\nclasses is minimal. As a result, the classi\ufb01er trained with\nCross-Entropy is susceptible to making incorrect predictions.\nAn intuitive alternative to the Cross-Entropy loss is the im-\nplementation of metric learning techniques, which involve\nlearning a distance metric from the data. Unlike conventional\nMachine Learning, where the aim is to learn a mapping func-\ntion between inputs and outputs, the goal of metric learning is\nto learn a metric that can be utilized to measure the distance\nbetween data points [39]. This distance metric can then be\nleveraged for making predictions or other tasks, maximizing\nthe inter-class distance and minimizing the intra-class distance.\nThe Additive Angular Margin Loss (AAML) [40] is a widely\nused loss function in Deep Learning for face recognition. It\nis designed to learn a discriminative feature representation for\nface images by maximizing the angular margin between the\nfeatures of the same identity while minimizing the angular\nmargin between the features of different identities. The AAML\nloss function is based on learning a weight vector and a feature\nvector for each identity. The angle between the weight and\nfeature vectors is maximized for the same identity and min-\nimized for different identities. The loss function encourages\nthe weight and feature vectors to lie on the surface of a\nhypersphere. The large margin between the vectors of the same\nand different identities enhances the learned feature represen-\ntation\u2019s discriminative power. The AAML loss function has\nbeen demonstrated to outperform other loss functions for face\nrecognition on several benchmark datasets, resulting in a 1.5%\nimprovement in classi\ufb01er accuracy.\nVI. DEEP-LEARNIG OPTIMIZER AND SCHEDULERS\nA. Training Optimizers\nThe purpose of an optimizer in deep learning is to determine\nthe set of parameters that minimize the loss function, thus\nyielding the model con\ufb01guration most representative of the\ndata. This is achieved through iterative re\ufb01nement of the model\nparameters, guided by various algorithms and techniques, with\nthe optimizer making progressive adjustments to the param-\neters until an optimal solution is reached. Commonly used\noptimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam [41],\nand RMSprop [42], each of which can signi\ufb01cantly impact\nthe performance of a deep learning model. Thus, the selection\nof the appropriate optimizer is a critical consideration.\nThe MadGrad [43] optimizer, a variation of the com-\nmonly used Adam [41], aims to improve the generalization\nperformance of deep learning models. This is achieved by\nincorporating multiplicative noise into the gradients during\nthe training process. Speci\ufb01cally, the gradients are multiplied\nby a random noise tensor at each iteration, derived from a\nGaussian distribution with a mean of 1 and a slight variance,\nand scaled by a factor that decreases over time. Results have\ndemonstrated that MadGrad outperforms Adam on various\ntasks, including image classi\ufb01cation and natural language\nprocessing. This study validated its effectiveness, resulting in\na 1.1% improvement in accuracy.\nB. Learning rate schedulers\nThe objective of a learning rate scheduler in deep learning\nis to modulate the learning rate. This crucial hyperparameter\ndetermines the magnitude of updates made to the model\u2019s\nparameters by the optimizer. Ineffective regulation of the\nlearning rate can result in either signi\ufb01cant, erratic updates that\nlead to suboptimal convergence or slow, incremental updates\nthat impede the pace of the training process. A learning rate\nscheduler resolves these issues by dynamically adjusting the\nlearning rate during training, using various techniques such as\n\ufb01xed scheduling, scheduling based on the training progress,\nor scheduling based on model performance. This contribution\ndemonstrates the ef\ufb01cacy of the combination of the Cosine\nAnnealing scheduler [44] and the ReducedLR scheduler [45]\nin stabilizing the learning process.\nThe ReducedLR scheduler [45] is a commonly utilized ap-\nproach in deep learning for regulating the learning rate during\nthe training process. This scheduler operates by reducing the\nlearning rate by a predetermined factor when the training\nloss fails to improve over a speci\ufb01ed number of epochs,\nthereby mitigating the risk of getting stuck in a suboptimal\nlocal minimum and enhancing the generalization performance\nof the model. Implementable as a callback function within\ndeep learning frameworks, the ReducedLR scheduler offers\nthe \ufb02exibility to specify the reduction factor and the number\nof epochs for which the learning rate reduction should be\ntriggered.\nThe CosineAnnealing scheduler [44] is a learning rate\nscheduler that adjusts the learning rate following a cosine\ncurve, which commences at a high value and gradually de-\ncreases to a lower value as training progresses. This technique\nhelps to improve the convergence of the training process\nand address the challenge of premature saturation, where the\nlearning rate becomes excessively low and the training slows\ndown.\nVII. REGULARIZATION\nRegularization is a widely employed technique in machine\nlearning for mitigating over\ufb01tting, which refers to the scenario\nin which a model demonstrates superior performance on the\n Architecture\nTechnique\nNTU\nCS\nCV\nRNN-based\nS-trans+RNN\n76.0\n82.3\nS-trans+RNN (aug.)\n77.0\n85.0\nVA-RNN\n79.4\n87.6\nVA-RNN (aug.)\n79.8\n88.9\nCNN-Based\nS-trans+CNN\n87.5\n92.2\nS-trans+CNN (aug.)\n87.9\n93.5\nVA-CNN\n88.2\n93.8\nVA-CNN (aug.)\n88.7\n94.3\nOur + ArcFace\n-\n95.0\nTABLE I\nEFFECTIVENESS (IN ACCURACY (%)) OF APPLYING (REGULARLIZATION, MADGRAD OPTIMIZER, MULTIPLE LEARNING SCHEDULERS)\nAugmentation\nImage-based\nWeak\nStrong\nFlipping\nBoth\n93.70\n93.62\nRotation\nBoth\n94.21\n94.1\nZoom\nImage\n93.60\n93.40\nShear\nImage\n94.03\n94.20\nTranslate-x\nImage\n93.71\n94.03\nTranslate-y\nImage\n94.24\n94.1\nCutout\nImage\n94.03\n94.1\nSalt and pepper noise\nImage\n93.52\n-\nBone Shuf\ufb02ing\nPose\n94.13\n93.96\nBone Masking\nPose\n93.80\n93.8\nFrame Masking\nBoth\n93.8\n93.75\nGaussian Noise\nImage\n93.5\n-\nSpeckle Noise\nImage\n93.45\n-\nLocalvars Noise\nImage\n93.5\n-\nSalt noise\nImage\n93.5\n-\nPepper Noise\nImage\n93.5\n-\nTABLE II\nVARIOUS AUGMENTATIONS APPLIED ON THE ENCODED SKELETON IMAGE MAP\ntraining data yet subpar performance on unseen data. Over\ufb01t-\nting transpires when the model has learned speci\ufb01c patterns in\nthe training data that do not generalize to other data, resulting\nin poor performance on previously unseen data. Regularization\nhelps to address over\ufb01tting by incorporating a penalty term in\nthe loss function during the training process. This promotes the\nmodel to learn more generalizable parameters, thereby yielding\nenhanced performance on new data. There exist several types\nof regularization methods, such as label smoothing regulariza-\ntion, dropout, batch normalization, and early stopping, which\ncan be utilized in a complementary manner to improve the\ngeneralizability of machine learning models.\nLabel Smoothing Regularization [46] is a popular regular-\nization technique utilized in deep learning to enhance the\ngeneralization performance of classi\ufb01ers. The objective of\nlabel smoothing is to reduce the con\ufb01dence of the classi\ufb01er\u2019s\npredictions, thereby improving its generalization capabilities\non new data. This technique is commonly utilized in image\nclassi\ufb01cation tasks, where instead of using one-hot encoded\ntraining data labels with a label vector of [0, 0, 1, 0] to\nindicate that an image belongs to class 3, label smoothing\nwould modify the label vector to [0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1], suggesting\nthat the image has a high probability of belonging to class 3\nbut also a tiny likelihood of belonging to the other classes. This\nregularizes the classi\ufb01er and reduces the risk of over\ufb01tting the\ntraining data. Essentially, one-hot encoded training data labels\nshould not contain zero values for the non-class index.\nEarly stopping, as described in [47], is a prevalent regular-\nization strategy utilized in deep learning to mitigate over\ufb01tting.\nThe technique entails prematurely halting the training process\nprior to the model\u2019s convergence to its optimal performance.\nThis is achieved by continuously monitoring the model\u2019s per-\nformance on a validation set and interrupting the training when\nthe performance either ceases to improve or begins to decline.\nThe objective of early stopping is to restrict over\ufb01tting, which\nis a situation where a model performs well on the training data\nbut poorly on unseen data. By curtailing the training before\nthe model attains full convergence, early stopping can enhance\nits ability to generalize to novel data and improve its overall\nperformance. Early stopping is a straightforward and practical\napproach that can be effortlessly integrated into most deep-\nlearning frameworks.\nDropout, as a regularization technique in deep learning,\naims to enhance the generalization performance of neural net-\nworks [?]. The approach involves randomly setting a speci\ufb01ed\nfraction of the activations of the neurons in the network to\nzero during training. This reduction in the co-adaptation of\nneurons leads to a network that is less sensitive to the speci\ufb01c\nweights of individual neurons. As a result, training a network\nwith dropouts can lead to learning more robust and diverse\nfeature representations, which are less prone to over\ufb01tting the\ntraining data. Dropout is commonly applied to fully-connected\nlayers in neural networks but can also be implemented in other\nlayer types, such as convolutional and recurrent layers. It is\nusually deployed with a high dropout rate (e.g., 0.5) during\ntraining and a low dropout rate (e.g., 0.1) or no dropout during\n inference.\nBatch normalization, as discussed in [48], is a technique\nemployed in deep learning to improve the performance and\nstability of neural networks. The strategy entails normalizing\nthe inputs to each layer in the network, which can expedite\nthe training process and enhance the generalization perfor-\nmance of the network. A batch normalization layer is inserted\nbetween the input and output of a neural network. It is\ndesigned to normalize the activations of the preceding layer\nusing the mean and variance of the current mini-batch of\ndata. This reduction of internal covariate shift, which refers\nto the phenomenon of the distribution of inputs to each layer\nevolving over time during training, can enhance the network\u2019s\nconvergence speed and stability and make it more resilient to\ninitialization parameter choices.\nVIII. DATASET AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nA. Dataset\nThe design of a data collection environment for capturing\nactions is dictated by the target task. For instance, the setup\nrequired for a gesture recognition task will differ from that\nrequired for a human interaction task. In most cases, the\ncaptured action occurs at the beginning of the sequence, obvi-\nating the need for action recognition without action detection.\nAdditionally, many datasets use a global capturing length,\nwhich simpli\ufb01es the data preprocessing by eliminating the\nrequirement for consistent length. The presence of non-action-\nrelated subjects in the scene is another challenge commonly\naddressed by capturing data in a controlled environment to\nensure that only sequences relevant to the task are captured.\nThe NTU RGB+D dataset, proposed by Shahroudy et al.\n[49], is a substantial multi-view action dataset with 56,000\nsamples from 40 individuals and 60 action classes, which\nare classi\ufb01ed into three categories: 40 daily activity classes,\nnine health-related classes, and 11 interaction classes. The Mi-\ncrosoft Kinect device was used for data collection, providing\nRGB, depth, skeleton, and infrared modalities. Three \ufb01xed\ncamera setups were utilized, with capturing angles ranging\nfrom -45 to 45 degrees, and the cameras\u2019 distance and height\nwere also varied to increase view variations. Liu et al. [50]\nfurther extended the NTU-60 dataset using the same capturing\nsystem and modalities, with 106 subjects performing 120\naction classes and 114,500 video samples.\nB. Performance Measures\nStandardizing evaluation metrics is crucial for fairly com-\nparing various approaches. The choice of metric depends on\nthe task, and some metrics may be more intuitive than others.\nThe choice of evaluation protocol may also play a role in\ndemonstrating the dif\ufb01culty and complexity of the scenario.\nThe Cross-views evaluation protocol, proposed by Shahroudy\net al. [49] and Liu et al. [51], assumes that samples from the\nsame view cannot be used for both training and testing, for\ninstance, camera 1 and 3 for training and camera 2 for testing\nonly.\nCross-subject evaluation protocol, also proposed by the\ncreators of the NTU-D 60 dataset [49], [51], dictates that the\nsubjects selected for training cannot be used for testing, with\n20 of the 40 subjects selected for training and the remaining\n20 for testing. Lastly, Liu et al. [51] also proposed the\ncross-setup evaluation protocol, which uses different vertical\nheights, distances, and backgrounds during the capturing to\ninclude natural variations, while keeping the horizontal three-\ncamera \ufb01xed in terms of capturing angle.\nIX. RESULTS\nWe replicated the results of the End-to-End Two Streams\nNetwork for Action Recognition as reported by et al. [33].\nWe established it as a baseline for our experiments. In their\nwork, Zhang et al. et al. [33] built upon their previous\ncontribution in [52] by proposing an End-to-End Two Streams\nNetwork for Action Recognition. The network comprises two\nstreams: one is similar to the one presented in [52], while the\nother is a CNN-based stream that includes a view adaptation\nsubnetwork with a similar architecture. This CNN stream\nleverages the skeleton representation proposed by Du et al.\n[16]. To enhance the robustness of the network, random\nrotation augmentation was incorporated on-the-\ufb02y. Finally,\nlate score fusion was applied with different stream weights,\nfavoring the CNN stream. Our results outperform those of\nthe Two-Stream View Adaptive Module, demonstrating the\npotential of our approach with simple training techniques. We\nincorporated all mentioned strategies and techniques to achieve\nthe results shown in the tables.\nX. CONCLUSION\nThe proliferation of sensing devices has increased the avail-\nability of diverse datasets in multiple modalities. Among these,\nskeleton-based modality holds promise due to its computation\nef\ufb01ciency and the wealth of information the human skeleton\nprovides. Accurately estimating human pose from the video\nis a prerequisite for extracting 3D skeleton data from various\nmodalities. In this work, we have shown that Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) utilizing diverse training techniques\ncan achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results comparable to\nthose obtained using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for\naction recognition tasks. Furthermore, our \ufb01ndings indicate\nthat using various data augmentation techniques can improve\nthe generalization and robustness of the model. This results in\nimproved performance on unseen data and reduced sensitivity\nto variations or distortions in the input. Additionally, we have\ndemonstrated that using MadGrad as the optimizer and im-\nplementing a learning rate scheduler can improve the model\u2019s\naccuracy. Furthermore, we have shown that using a margin-\nbased cosine loss function instead of the traditional cross-\nentropy loss can enhance the model\u2019s performance, leading to\nmore accurate predictions and improved overall results. Regu-\nlarization techniques can further prevent over\ufb01tting, improving\nthe model\u2019s performance on unseen data.\n REFERENCES\n[1] Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E Hinton.\nImagenet\nclassi\ufb01cation with deep convolutional neural networks.\nAdvances in\nneural information processing systems, 25:1097\u20131105, 2012.\n[2] Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick, and Jian Sun.\nFaster r-\ncnn: Towards real-time object detection with region proposal networks.\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 28:91\u201399, 2015.\n[3] Susan Barker, Rebecca Craik, William Freedman, Nira Herrmann, and\nHoward Hillstrom.

Despite this, researchers continue to\nexplore and investigate the most optimal way to represent\nhuman actions through skeleton representation and the extracted\nfeatures. As a result, the growth and availability of human action\nrecognition datasets have risen substantially. In addition, deep\nlearning-based algorithms have gained widespread popularity\ndue to the remarkable advancements in various computer vision\ntasks.

Our approach has been rigorously validated, and we\nhave achieved a score of 95% on the NTU-60 dataset.\nI.INTRODUCTION\nRecently, the research community has been witnessing a\nsurging interest in skeleton-based action recognition, owing\nto its many advantageous attributes such as computational\nef\ufb01ciency, informative features, and immunity to changes in\nlighting conditions. The \ufb01eld continues to explore the optimal\nway of representing human actions through skeleton represen-\ntation and feature extraction. This has resulted in a marked\nincrease in the number of human action recognition datasets.\nOn the other hand, deep learning-based algorithms have gained\nimmense popularity as a result of their effectiveness in various\ncomputer vision tasks. Most cutting-edge contributions in the\nrealm of skeleton-based action recognition adopt Graph Neu-\nral Network (GCN) architecture for representing the human\nbody\u2019s articulated structure and extracting features. However,\nour \ufb01ndings demonstrate that Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) can deliver comparable results to GCN if proper\ntraining methods, data augmentation techniques, and the ap-\npropriate optimizer are utilized.\nThe prospect of equipping machines with human-like vi-\nsual capabilities has garnered signi\ufb01cant attention among\nresearchers, inspiring the development of various technologies,\nalgorithms, and techniques to facilitate this task. To date,\nnumerous computer vision tasks have been successfully ad-\ndressed, including image classi\ufb01cation [1] and object detection\n[2]. Among the active research areas in computer vision ishuman activity analysis in videos, including human action\ndetection, recognition, and prediction.\nThe human gesture, which is characterized by a shorter\nduration and less complex movements performed by a lim-\nited number of body parts, represents the \ufb01rst category of\nhuman action. Examples of human gestures include hand\nwaving and head nodding. On the other hand, human action\nencompasses longer-duration movements involving more body\nparts. A sequence comprising multiple actions is referred to\nas human activity. Finally, human interaction contains human\ninteractions with the surrounding environment, including both\nhuman-to-human and human-to-object interactions. The pres-\nence of multiple humans or interactions with various objects\nincreases the complexity of motion analysis, which can further\nbe complicated by online or of\ufb02ine human behavior analysis.\nIn the past, capturing human actions through human-\nperformance systems often necessitated the application of\nmarkers on the subjects\u2019 bodies and the use of distinctive\nattire. Despite overcoming these limitations, the high cost of\ncameras remained a hindrance to widespread adoption [3].\nHowever, recent advancements have led to the development of\ncost-effective contactless sensing devices, such as Microsoft\nKinect, Intel Realsense, and Doppler radar. Historically, the\nRGB modality in human action capture has been challenged by\nvarious factors, including illumination, occlusions, background\nclutter, frame rate, viewpoint, and biometric variations. By\ncontrast, RGB-D sensors have mitigated some of these dif-\n\ufb01culties, particularly with regard to illumination, and provide\na crucial advantage by enabling the generation of 3D structural\ninformation of the scene. As a result, estimating 3D human\nskeleton joints has become a relatively straightforward process\nin the RGB-D modality.\nFor many years, machine learning algorithms have been the\nprimary technologies incorporated to address various computer\nvision problems, including action recognition. The conven-\ntional approach to human motion analysis involves capturing\nand representing spatiotemporal information, which enhances\nthe accuracy and robustness of the analysis. Typically, features\nare extracted manually and incorporated into classical machine\nlearning algorithms to perform different tasks. The research\ncommunity has explored various features representations, in-\ncluding joint coordinates [4], the center of gravity [5], the\nangle between skeleton joints [6], motion velocity [7], andarXiv:2301.13360v1  [cs.CV]  31 Jan 2023 co-occurrence features [8]. The selection of the appropriate\nalgorithm also recreates a vital role in the machine learning\nera. Many algorithms have been utilized, including Support\nVector Machine (SVM) [9], Linear Discriminant Analysis\n(LDA) [10], Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor [11], Logistic\nRegression [12], and KNN [13]. However, the generalization\nof machine learning algorithms is challenging and requires\nsigni\ufb01cant effort in feature engineering.\nRecent advancements in deep learning-based techniques\nhave demonstrated superior performance in various computer\nvision problems, such as image classi\ufb01cation [1], object de-\ntection [2], action recognition [14], and action detection [15].\nThe increasing interest in skeleton-based representation has\nbeen driven by the abundant and discriminative features that\ncan be derived from skeleton joints. For instance, features\nsuch as Skeleton Map [16], Joint Trajectory Map [17], Joint\nDistance Map [18], and many others can be extracted from the\nskeleton joint data alone. Consequently, the utilization of deep-\nlearning algorithms has emerged as a prevalent approach for\nskeleton-based human action recognition. Our contributions\nare summarized as follows:\n\u000fConstruct an easy-to-integrate and modular Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) for the action recognition task,\nwhich attains results comparable to the State-of-the-Art\n(SOTA) methods.\n\u000fDespite the prevalence of graph neural network-based\nmethods in the SOTA contributions to the action recogni-\ntion task, we demonstrate that CNNs can attain compara-\nble results by implementing various training techniques.\n\u000fOur results indicate that incorporating a diverse set of\naugmentation techniques leads to an improvement in the\ngeneralization and robustness of the model.\n\u000fOur \ufb01ndings reveal that utilizing a margin-based cosine\nloss function instead of the conventional cross-entropy\nloss leads to a signi\ufb01cant enhancement in performance.\nII.RELATED WORK\nDeep-learning approaches have been demonstrated superi-\nority over conventional machine learning algorithms in vari-\nous computer vision tasks, including image classi\ufb01cation as\ndemonstrated in [1] in the ImageNet dataset, object detection\nas introduced by Ren et al. [2] with their Faster R-CNN\nframework, action recognition as recently revisited by Duan\net al [14], and action detection as proposed by Wang et\nal. [15]. In recent years, skeleton-based representations have\ngarnered increasing attention due to the wealth of rich and\ndiscriminative features that can be obtained from the skeleton\njoints. Examples of such representations include the Skeleton\nMap [16], Joint Trajectory Map [17], Joint Distance Map\n[18], among others, all of which are based solely on features\nextracted from the skeleton joints data.\n1)Convolution Neural Network - CNN Approaches :\nWang et al. [17] proposed the Joint Trajectory Map (JTM),\na representation that captures the spatiotemporal information\nof a sequence in the form of 2D images. This work emphasizeshuman motion magnitude and speed as the core features, rep-\nresented by the saturation value in the HSV (Hue-Saturation-\nValue) color space, with higher motion magnitude and speed\nyielding a higher saturation value. Du et al. [16] introduced\na method for encoding the spatiotemporal features of an\naction sequence into an image matrix. This representation is\nconstructed by vertically encoding the skeleton\u2019s joint coor-\ndinates into the RGB channels and horizontally encoding the\nsequence frames. The encoded information is then quanti\ufb01ed,\nnormalized, and transformed into an image for use with a\nCNN classi\ufb01cation network. In addition to the skeleton map\nrepresentation proposed by Du et al. , Liet al. [19] proposed\na two-stream CNN-based network that leverages the skeleton\nmap. Li et al. [18] extracted discriminative features from the\npair-wise distances between skeleton joints in a human action\nsequence to construct a Joint Distance Map (JDM), which\nmaps the skeleton sequence into images. Bilinear interpolation\nwas applied to address the issue of variable sequence duration.\nLiet al. [8] embarked on the problem of joint co-occurrence\nby proposing an end-to-end hierarchical framework that fa-\ncilitates better feature learning, gradually aggregating point-\nlevel features into global co-occurrence features. Ke et al. [20]\nproposed a translation, scale, and rotation invariant body part\nvector-based representation, using geometrical features of the\nskeleton to generate two sets of features: cosine distance and\nnormalized magnitude. The human skeleton joints are grouped\ninto \ufb01ve parts: trunk, right arm, left arm, right leg, and left leg.\nBoth cosine distance and normalized magnitude features are\ncomputed within the body and skeleton, yielding ten feature\nvectors fed into a CNN for further feature extraction and\ntraining.\n2)Recurrent Neural Network - RNN Approaches :The\nrecognition of human actions is a problem of spatiotempo-\nral representation. To capture the discriminative features, re-\nsearchers have proposed utilizing conventional RNN networks.\nYet, the vanishing gradient problem has necessitated adapting\nmemory gating techniques, such as long-short term memory\n(LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). To address this issue,\nDuet al. [21] proposed a hierarchical bidirectional recurrent\nneural network (BRNN) that models the long-term temporal\nsequence through an end-to-end approach. To facilitate better\nfeature representation, the human body is divided into \ufb01ve\nparts and processed through \ufb01ve different BRNN subnets.\nThe outputs are fused and classi\ufb01ed in higher layers before\nbeing fed into the \ufb01nal BRNN. To further improve the sys-\ntem\u2019s robustness, Du et al. [22] implemented random rotation\ntransformation during preprocessing and scale transformation\nto account for varying human sizes. Salient motion patterns\nhave been leveraged as essential features in various human\naction-related tasks. However, LSTM struggles to capture\nthe spatiotemporal dynamics. To resolve this, Veeriah et al.\n[23] proposed a differential gating for LSTM-RNN networks\nthat quanti\ufb01es the salient motion between frames through the\nderivative of state (DoS). Skeleton-based action recognition\npresents several challenges, including the intra-frame joint\nspatiotemporal information of all frames in a sequence. To address these challenges, Sogn et al. [24] proposed an end-\nto-end spatiotemporal attention model that adaptively learns\nintra-frame and inter-frame dependencies through recurrent\nRNN and LSTM. Human skeleton data contains discriminative\nfeatures such as acceleration, angles, spatial coordinates, orien-\ntation, and velocity. Zhang et al. [25] evaluated eight geometric\nfeatures on a 3-layer LSTM network and found that computing\nthe distance between joints and selected lines outperformed the\nother features.\n3)Graph Convolution Network - GCN Approaches :\nYan et al. [26] introduced the initial spatiotemporal graph\nconvolutional network (ST-GCN), which established edges\nbetween joints in both the intra-frame and inter-frame dimen-\nsions. Typically, in graph-based techniques, the convolution\noperation is performed over the neighboring joints within the\nreceptive \ufb01eld. However, conducting a convolution over non-\nEuclidean data necessitates a judicious partition strategy to\nattain a label map. Although ST-GCN [26] achieved substantial\nresults in the human action recognition task, it faced several\nlimitations. The graph representation in ST-GCN was created\nbased on the human body\u2019s physical structure, which may not\nbe ideal for characterizing human action. For example, in an\nact like clapping, the relationship between the hands is crucial\nin classifying the action. In this case, ST-GCN fails to capture\nsuch a relationship since the two hands are not connected and\nare distant from each other in the kinematic tree. Additionally,\ncertain geometric features, such as bone orientation and length,\nare challenging to represent in graph-based algorithms. To\novercome these limitations, Shi et al. [27] proposed an end-\nto-end data-driven multi-stream attention-enhanced adaptive\ngraph convolutional network (MS-AAGCN), where the graph\ntopology is learned and generated adaptively from the input\ndata. In practical scenarios, occlusion is a prevalent challenge\nthat is often unavoidable. Song et al. [28] proposed a GCN-\nbased model that is trained on incomplete spatiotemporal\nskeleton data, with intra-frame joints and inter-frame frames\nmasked to imitate occlusion effects. Moreover, Yoon et al.\n[29] incorporated noise into the skeleton data to enhance the\nmodel\u2019s robustness.\nIII. DATA PREPROCESSING\nTypically, skeleton data is represented in a camera coordi-\nnate system, leading to a diverse representation of captured\nsequences from different viewpoints, as illustrated in Figures\n3 (A), (B), and (C). To mitigate the impact of view variation,\na common approach is to transform the skeleton data into a\nuni\ufb01ed coordinate system [30]\u2013[33]. This is typically accom-\nplished through a sequence of geometric translation, rotation,\nand normalization operations, as depicted in Figures 3 (D), (E),\nand (F). There are various transformation strategies presented\nin the literature. In frame-based approaches, the transformation\noperation is applied to each frame in the sequence, which,\nhowever, results in the loss of some relative motions. For\nexample, when applied to the walking action, this technique\nproduces an effect as if walking on a treadmill. On the\nother hand, in sequence-based strategies, the \ufb01rst frame inthe sequence is designated as the reference frame, and all\ntransformations applied to the subsequent frames are relative\nto this reference frame. This approach provides a more realistic\nrepresentation of human skeleton motions.\nFig. 1. Action representation from NTU-D 60 dataset A) -45\u00b0skeleton\nvisualization, B) 0 \u00b0skeleton visualization, C) 45\u00b0skeleton visualization. (D,\nE, F) are the transformed skeleton for the same skeletons in (A, B, C)\nA. Encoding Skeleton to Image\nGiven a sequence of skeletons S, where s2(1; :::; S ), and\nthejthjoint in the tthframe of skeleton sis represented\nasst;j= [xt;j; yt;j; zt;j], with j2(1; :::; J )denoting the\nnumber of joints in a frame and t2(1; :::; T )denoting the\ntotal number of frames in the sequence S.\nInspired by the work of Du et al. [16], we transform the raw\nskeleton data into a skeleton map image that preserves spa-\ntiotemporal information, as depicted in Fig. 2. Given an RGB\nimage of dimensions [H; W; C ], where Hrepresents height,\nWrepresents width, and Crepresents the conventional RGB\nimage channels, we map the action sequence S, represented\nin the dimension of T\u0002N\u00023, to an image of dimensions\n[H; W; C ]. Here, Trepresents the number of frames and maps\nto the height of the image, Nrepresents the number of joints\nand maps to the width of the image, and the last dimension\nrepresents the 3D joint coordinates of the joints in a frame,\nwhich are mapped to the three channels of the image.\nSince raw skeleton data may have different value ranges\nthan the image, pixel normalization is necessary to ensure\nthat the mapped values are in the range of 0\u0000255. This is\naccomplished by:\nPt;j=floor (255\u0002st;j\u0000Cmin\nCmax\u0000Cmin) (1)\nIV.DATA AUGMENTATION\nData augmentation is a well-established technique utilized\nto enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms\nby diversifying the training data. This approach involves syn-\nthesizing new samples from the existing training data by em-\nploying transformations such as scaling, rotation, translation,\nand other deformations. Adding these transformed samples to\nthe training set can improve the generalization performance\nof the machine learning algorithm, making it more resilient Fig. 2. The pipeline of generating the skeleton map image\nto variations in the input data. Data augmentation is widely\napplied across several deep-learning tasks, including image\nclassi\ufb01cation, object detection, and natural language process-\ning.\nOn the other hand, Skeleton-based data augmentation is\nused explicitly for tasks involving 3D pose information, such\nas 3D human pose estimation. This approach involves trans-\nforming the 3D joint positions of a skeleton to generate new\npose samples. Image-based data augmentation is utilized for\ntasks where the input data consists of images, including image\nclassi\ufb01cation and object detection.\nIn this research, we investigated various image-based and\nskeleton-based techniques for data augmentation, as outlined\nin TABLE. Our approach is inspired by RandAugmentation\n[34], which randomly injects the training pipeline with prede-\n\ufb01ned augmentations based on the number and magnitude of\naugmentations to be applied.\nThe Flipping Sequence augmentation technique, as de-\nscribed in [35], involves the generation of synthetic pose\nsequences by horizontally \ufb02ipping the input pose sequences.\nThis is achieved through the re\ufb02ection of the 3D joint positions\nacross a horizontal plane when applied to skeleton data and\nby \ufb02ipping in both the horizontal and vertical planes when\napplied to image data. As a result, a new pose sequence with\nactions performed in the opposite direction is produced.\nThe Geometric Rotation augmentation, as discussed in\n[34], generates new synthetic samples by applying random\nrotations to the input data. This is achieved by rotating the\ninput images or 3D objects around a \ufb01xed point, utilizing a\nspeci\ufb01ed angle and center of rotation.\nThe Cutout augmentation, as presented in [36], is a regu-\nlarization technique utilized in deep learning. This technique\ninvolves randomly masking a portion of an image during\nthe training process, which necessitates the model to learn\nto ignore these regions and focus on the remaining parts.\nThis can enhance the model\u2019s generalization to new data, thus\nimproving its performance. Cutout augmentation is frequently\nadopted in image classi\ufb01cation tasks, where it can aid the\nmodel in recognizing objects in images, despite variations in\ntheir appearance. It can be easily implemented in most deep\nlearning frameworks as a simple and effective regularization\nmethod for deep learning models.\nThe Zoom augmentation, as described in [34], involves\nrescaling the input images or 3D objects using a speci\ufb01edzoom factor, which determines the extent of the zooming.\nThis augmentation method is appropriate for both image\nand skeleton data. Additionally, the Shear augmentation, as\ndiscussed in Cubuk et al. (2020) [34], is achieved through\nthe utilization of a linear transformation that maps the x-\naxis or y-axis coordinates of the input data to new positions.\nThe Translate augmentation, also presented in Cubuk et al.\n(2020) [34], involves the shifting of the x-axis, y-axis, or both\ncoordinates of the input data by a speci\ufb01ed amount.\nThe introduction of various types of noise to image data\nduring training has been demonstrated to enhance the gen-\neralizability and robustness of machine learning models [37].\nSalt-and-Pepper noise [38] is a form of noise that mimics the\neffect of corrupted or missing pixels in the input data. This is\nachieved by randomly setting a speci\ufb01ed proportion of pixels\nto either the minimum or maximum intensity value, creating\nthe appearance of salt and pepper grains on the image. The\nremaining pixels remain unaltered.\nAnother noise-based augmentation strategy is Localvars\nnoise [37]. This method generates random noise samples from\na speci\ufb01ed distribution. Speckle noise [37] generates random\nnoise samples from a Poisson distribution with a speci\ufb01ed\nmean. In contrast, Gaussian noise [37] generates random noise\nsamples from a Gaussian distribution with a speci\ufb01ed mean\nand standard deviation.\nIn the context of skeleton data, Bone Shuf\ufb02ing augmenta-\ntion is applied. This is achieved by randomly permuting the\n3D joint positions of the skeleton, resulting in a new pose\nsequence in which a different body con\ufb01guration performs the\nsame actions. Additionally, Bone Masking augmentation is\nimplemented by setting the 3D joint positions of the skeleton\nto zero for a randomly selected subset of bones. A similar\ntechnique can also be applied on the frame level rather than\nthe bone level.\nFig. 3. Various augmentation implementation V. L OSS FUNCTION\nIn the realm of Deep Learning, a loss function serves\nas an evaluation metric of a model\u2019s ability to predict the\ndesired outcome. The objective of training a model is to\n\ufb01nd the optimal set of parameters that minimize the loss\nfunction, leading to the model\u2019s improved accuracy in making\npredictions on unseen data. The use of classi\ufb01cation loss is\nprevalent in classifying outputs into discrete class labels. The\nCross-Entropy loss is a popular choice for action recogni-\ntion classi\ufb01cation problems [39]. Although the Cross-Entropy\nloss often proves effective in training models, it has certain\nlimitations, including sensitivity to the relative magnitude of\npredicted and true values, rendering it challenging to use in\nspeci\ufb01c scenarios.\nOne critical observation when utilizing the Cross-Entropy\nloss function is that the distance between samples of different\nclasses is minimal. As a result, the classi\ufb01er trained with\nCross-Entropy is susceptible to making incorrect predictions.\nAn intuitive alternative to the Cross-Entropy loss is the im-\nplementation of metric learning techniques, which involve\nlearning a distance metric from the data. Unlike conventional\nMachine Learning, where the aim is to learn a mapping func-\ntion between inputs and outputs, the goal of metric learning is\nto learn a metric that can be utilized to measure the distance\nbetween data points [39]. This distance metric can then be\nleveraged for making predictions or other tasks, maximizing\nthe inter-class distance and minimizing the intra-class distance.\nThe Additive Angular Margin Loss (AAML) [40] is a widely\nused loss function in Deep Learning for face recognition. It\nis designed to learn a discriminative feature representation for\nface images by maximizing the angular margin between the\nfeatures of the same identity while minimizing the angular\nmargin between the features of different identities. The AAML\nloss function is based on learning a weight vector and a feature\nvector for each identity. The angle between the weight and\nfeature vectors is maximized for the same identity and min-\nimized for different identities. The loss function encourages\nthe weight and feature vectors to lie on the surface of a\nhypersphere. The large margin between the vectors of the same\nand different identities enhances the learned feature represen-\ntation\u2019s discriminative power. The AAML loss function has\nbeen demonstrated to outperform other loss functions for face\nrecognition on several benchmark datasets, resulting in a 1.5%\nimprovement in classi\ufb01er accuracy.\nVI. D EEP-LEARNIG OPTIMIZER AND SCHEDULERS\nA. Training Optimizers\nThe purpose of an optimizer in deep learning is to determine\nthe set of parameters that minimize the loss function, thus\nyielding the model con\ufb01guration most representative of the\ndata. This is achieved through iterative re\ufb01nement of the model\nparameters, guided by various algorithms and techniques, with\nthe optimizer making progressive adjustments to the param-\neters until an optimal solution is reached. Commonly used\noptimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam [41],and RMSprop [42], each of which can signi\ufb01cantly impact\nthe performance of a deep learning model. Thus, the selection\nof the appropriate optimizer is a critical consideration.\nThe MadGrad [43] optimizer, a variation of the com-\nmonly used Adam [41], aims to improve the generalization\nperformance of deep learning models. This is achieved by\nincorporating multiplicative noise into the gradients during\nthe training process. Speci\ufb01cally, the gradients are multiplied\nby a random noise tensor at each iteration, derived from a\nGaussian distribution with a mean of 1 and a slight variance,\nand scaled by a factor that decreases over time. Results have\ndemonstrated that MadGrad outperforms Adam on various\ntasks, including image classi\ufb01cation and natural language\nprocessing. This study validated its effectiveness, resulting in\na 1.1% improvement in accuracy.\nB. Learning rate schedulers\nThe objective of a learning rate scheduler in deep learning\nis to modulate the learning rate. This crucial hyperparameter\ndetermines the magnitude of updates made to the model\u2019s\nparameters by the optimizer. Ineffective regulation of the\nlearning rate can result in either signi\ufb01cant, erratic updates that\nlead to suboptimal convergence or slow, incremental updates\nthat impede the pace of the training process. A learning rate\nscheduler resolves these issues by dynamically adjusting the\nlearning rate during training, using various techniques such as\n\ufb01xed scheduling, scheduling based on the training progress,\nor scheduling based on model performance. This contribution\ndemonstrates the ef\ufb01cacy of the combination of the Cosine\nAnnealing scheduler [44] and the ReducedLR scheduler [45]\nin stabilizing the learning process.\nThe ReducedLR scheduler [45] is a commonly utilized ap-\nproach in deep learning for regulating the learning rate during\nthe training process. This scheduler operates by reducing the\nlearning rate by a predetermined factor when the training\nloss fails to improve over a speci\ufb01ed number of epochs,\nthereby mitigating the risk of getting stuck in a suboptimal\nlocal minimum and enhancing the generalization performance\nof the model. Implementable as a callback function within\ndeep learning frameworks, the ReducedLR scheduler offers\nthe \ufb02exibility to specify the reduction factor and the number\nof epochs for which the learning rate reduction should be\ntriggered.\nThe CosineAnnealing scheduler [44] is a learning rate\nscheduler that adjusts the learning rate following a cosine\ncurve, which commences at a high value and gradually de-\ncreases to a lower value as training progresses. This technique\nhelps to improve the convergence of the training process\nand address the challenge of premature saturation, where the\nlearning rate becomes excessively low and the training slows\ndown.\nVII.

Over\ufb01t-\nting transpires when the model has learned speci\ufb01c patterns in\nthe training data that do not generalize to other data, resulting\nin poor performance on previously unseen data. Regularization\nhelps to address over\ufb01tting by incorporating a penalty term in\nthe loss function during the training process. This promotes the\nmodel to learn more generalizable parameters, thereby yielding\nenhanced performance on new data. There exist several types\nof regularization methods, such as label smoothing regulariza-\ntion, dropout, batch normalization, and early stopping, which\ncan be utilized in a complementary manner to improve the\ngeneralizability of machine learning models.\nLabel Smoothing Regularization [46] is a popular regular-\nization technique utilized in deep learning to enhance the\ngeneralization performance of classi\ufb01ers. The objective of\nlabel smoothing is to reduce the con\ufb01dence of the classi\ufb01er\u2019s\npredictions, thereby improving its generalization capabilities\non new data. This technique is commonly utilized in image\nclassi\ufb01cation tasks, where instead of using one-hot encoded\ntraining data labels with a label vector of [0, 0, 1, 0] to\nindicate that an image belongs to class 3, label smoothing\nwould modify the label vector to [0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1], suggesting\nthat the image has a high probability of belonging to class 3\nbut also a tiny likelihood of belonging to the other classes. This\nregularizes the classi\ufb01er and reduces the risk of over\ufb01tting the\ntraining data. Essentially, one-hot encoded training data labels\nshould not contain zero values for the non-class index.\nEarly stopping, as described in [47], is a prevalent regular-ization strategy utilized in deep learning to mitigate over\ufb01tting.\nThe technique entails prematurely halting the training process\nprior to the model\u2019s convergence to its optimal performance.\nThis is achieved by continuously monitoring the model\u2019s per-\nformance on a validation set and interrupting the training when\nthe performance either ceases to improve or begins to decline.\nThe objective of early stopping is to restrict over\ufb01tting, which\nis a situation where a model performs well on the training data\nbut poorly on unseen data. By curtailing the training before\nthe model attains full convergence, early stopping can enhance\nits ability to generalize to novel data and improve its overall\nperformance. Early stopping is a straightforward and practical\napproach that can be effortlessly integrated into most deep-\nlearning frameworks.\nDropout, as a regularization technique in deep learning,\naims to enhance the generalization performance of neural net-\nworks [ ?]. The approach involves randomly setting a speci\ufb01ed\nfraction of the activations of the neurons in the network to\nzero during training. This reduction in the co-adaptation of\nneurons leads to a network that is less sensitive to the speci\ufb01c\nweights of individual neurons. As a result, training a network\nwith dropouts can lead to learning more robust and diverse\nfeature representations, which are less prone to over\ufb01tting the\ntraining data. Dropout is commonly applied to fully-connected\nlayers in neural networks but can also be implemented in other\nlayer types, such as convolutional and recurrent layers. It is\nusually deployed with a high dropout rate (e.g., 0.5) during\ntraining and a low dropout rate (e.g., 0.1) or no dropout during inference.\nBatch normalization, as discussed in [48], is a technique\nemployed in deep learning to improve the performance and\nstability of neural networks. The strategy entails normalizing\nthe inputs to each layer in the network, which can expedite\nthe training process and enhance the generalization perfor-\nmance of the network. A batch normalization layer is inserted\nbetween the input and output of a neural network. It is\ndesigned to normalize the activations of the preceding layer\nusing the mean and variance of the current mini-batch of\ndata. This reduction of internal covariate shift, which refers\nto the phenomenon of the distribution of inputs to each layer\nevolving over time during training, can enhance the network\u2019s\nconvergence speed and stability and make it more resilient to\ninitialization parameter choices.\nVIII. D ATASET AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nA. Dataset\nThe design of a data collection environment for capturing\nactions is dictated by the target task. For instance, the setup\nrequired for a gesture recognition task will differ from that\nrequired for a human interaction task. In most cases, the\ncaptured action occurs at the beginning of the sequence, obvi-\nating the need for action recognition without action detection.\nAdditionally, many datasets use a global capturing length,\nwhich simpli\ufb01es the data preprocessing by eliminating the\nrequirement for consistent length. The presence of non-action-\nrelated subjects in the scene is another challenge commonly\naddressed by capturing data in a controlled environment to\nensure that only sequences relevant to the task are captured.\nThe NTU RGB+D dataset, proposed by Shahroudy et al.\n[49], is a substantial multi-view action dataset with 56,000\nsamples from 40 individuals and 60 action classes, which\nare classi\ufb01ed into three categories: 40 daily activity classes,\nnine health-related classes, and 11 interaction classes. The Mi-\ncrosoft Kinect device was used for data collection, providing\nRGB, depth, skeleton, and infrared modalities. Three \ufb01xed\ncamera setups were utilized, with capturing angles ranging\nfrom -45 to 45 degrees, and the cameras\u2019 distance and height\nwere also varied to increase view variations. Liu et al. [50]\nfurther extended the NTU-60 dataset using the same capturing\nsystem and modalities, with 106 subjects performing 120\naction classes and 114,500 video samples.\nB.Performance Measures\nStandardizing evaluation metrics is crucial for fairly com-\nparing various approaches. The choice of metric depends on\nthe task, and some metrics may be more intuitive than others.\nThe choice of evaluation protocol may also play a role in\ndemonstrating the dif\ufb01culty and complexity of the scenario.\nTheCross-views evaluation protocol, proposed by Shahroudy\net al. [49] and Liu et al. [51], assumes that samples from the\nsame view cannot be used for both training and testing, for\ninstance, camera 1 and 3 for training and camera 2 for testing\nonly.Cross-subject evaluation protocol, also proposed by the\ncreators of the NTU-D 60 dataset [49], [51], dictates that the\nsubjects selected for training cannot be used for testing, with\n20 of the 40 subjects selected for training and the remaining\n20 for testing. Lastly, Liu et al. [51] also proposed the\ncross-setup evaluation protocol, which uses different vertical\nheights, distances, and backgrounds during the capturing to\ninclude natural variations, while keeping the horizontal three-\ncamera \ufb01xed in terms of capturing angle.\nIX. R ESULTS\nWe replicated the results of the End-to-End Two Streams\nNetwork for Action Recognition as reported by et al. [33].\nWe established it as a baseline for our experiments. In their\nwork, Zhang et al. et al. [33] built upon their previous\ncontribution in [52] by proposing an End-to-End Two Streams\nNetwork for Action Recognition. The network comprises two\nstreams: one is similar to the one presented in [52], while the\nother is a CNN-based stream that includes a view adaptation\nsubnetwork with a similar architecture. This CNN stream\nleverages the skeleton representation proposed by Du et al.\n[16]. To enhance the robustness of the network, random\nrotation augmentation was incorporated on-the-\ufb02y. Finally,\nlate score fusion was applied with different stream weights,\nfavoring the CNN stream. Our results outperform those of\nthe Two-Stream View Adaptive Module, demonstrating the\npotential of our approach with simple training techniques. We\nincorporated all mentioned strategies and techniques to achieve\nthe results shown in the tables.\nX. C ONCLUSION\nThe proliferation of sensing devices has increased the avail-\nability of diverse datasets in multiple modalities. Among these,\nskeleton-based modality holds promise due to its computation\nef\ufb01ciency and the wealth of information the human skeleton\nprovides. Accurately estimating human pose from the video\nis a prerequisite for extracting 3D skeleton data from various\nmodalities. In this work, we have shown that Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) utilizing diverse training techniques\ncan achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results comparable to\nthose obtained using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for\naction recognition tasks. Furthermore, our \ufb01ndings indicate\nthat using various data augmentation techniques can improve\nthe generalization and robustness of the model. This results in\nimproved performance on unseen data and reduced sensitivity\nto variations or distortions in the input. Additionally, we have\ndemonstrated that using MadGrad as the optimizer and im-\nplementing a learning rate scheduler can improve the model\u2019s\naccuracy. Furthermore, we have shown that using a margin-\nbased cosine loss function instead of the traditional cross-\nentropy loss can enhance the model\u2019s performance, leading to\nmore accurate predictions and improved overall results. Regu-\nlarization techniques can further prevent over\ufb01tting, improving\nthe model\u2019s performance on unseen data. REFERENCES\n[1] Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

        "1_question": "How does the proposed approach compare to existing graph neural network (GCN) methods?",
        "1_answers:eli5": "The study found that with appropriate training and optimization techniques, CNNs can achieve comparable results to GCN methods in action recognition tasks.",

        "2_additional_depth_q:follow up question": "Could you elaborate on how the proposed approach enhances the model's robustness against overfitting?",
        "2_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "The proposed approach utilizes various regularization techniques to help the model learn more generalizable features. Regularization prevents the model from learning specific patterns in the training data that do not generalize well to unseen data. By incorporating a penalty term in the loss function during training, regularization encourages the model to find solutions that are less sensitive to noise and outliers in the data. This results in a model that is more robust against overfitting and performs better on unseen data.",
        "2_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The proposed approach employs a combination of regularization techniques, including label smoothing regularization, dropout, batch normalization, and early stopping, to enhance the model's robustness against overfitting. Label smoothing regularization reduces the confidence of the classifier's predictions, making it less sensitive to noise and outliers in the data. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training, preventing the model from relying too heavily on any particular feature. Batch normalization normalizes the activations of each layer, reducing the impact of covariate shift and improving the model's stability during training. Early stopping terminates the training process when the model's performance on a validation set starts to degrade, preventing overfitting. These regularization techniques work together to promote the model's generalization capabilities and enhance its performance on unseen data.",

They demonstrated that incorporating these augmentations significantly improves the robustness and generalization of the CNN model.\n\n4. **Benefits of Margin-based Loss Function:** The study introduces a margin-based cosine loss function, the Additive Angular Margin Loss (AAML), which outperforms the conventional cross-entropy loss for skeleton-based action recognition. This loss function encourages the model to learn discriminative features by maximizing the angular margin between different classes.\n\n5. **Optimization and Learning Rate Scheduling:** The research team employed the MadGrad optimizer and a combination of the CosineAnnealing and ReducedLR schedulers to optimize the learning process. These techniques contribute to the stability and convergence of the training process, leading to improved model performance.\n\nOverall, the proposed approach provides valuable insights into the effective use of CNNs for skeleton-based human action recognition, offering a practical and competitive alternative to GCN-based methods.",

This improved class separation contributes to higher accuracy in action recognition.",
        "3_additional_depth_q:follow up question": "How does the margin-based cosine loss function contribute to the model's performance?",
        "3_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "Imagine you have a race and the goal is to get as far away from other runners as possible. The margin-based cosine loss function is like a referee who helps you do that. It makes sure that when you win a race, you don't just win by a little bit, but by a big margin. This way, it's harder for other runners to catch up to you and you're more likely to stay in the lead.",
        "3_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The margin-based cosine loss function introduces a margin between the cosine similarities of correct and incorrect class pairs, ensuring that the model not only correctly classifies the samples but also maximizes the distance between different classes. This margin helps prevent the model from making incorrect predictions, especially when the samples from different classes are similar.",
        "3_additional_breath_q:follow up question": "How does the margin-based cosine loss function contribute to action recognition compared to regular cross-entropy loss?",
        "3_additional_breath_q:answers:eli5": "Imagine you have a bunch of shapes, and you want to separate the shapes into different groups based on their shape. If you use the regular cross-entropy loss, it's like you're trying to push the shapes apart but you don't care how far apart they are. But with the margin-based cosine loss, it's like you're trying to push the shapes apart by a certain distance, which helps to make the separation between the groups clearer.",
        "3_additional_breath_q:answers:expert": "The margin-based cosine loss function contributes to action recognition by maximizing the distance between different classes while minimizing the distance within the same class. This helps the model to better separate different actions and improve recognition accuracy. Compared to the regular cross-entropy loss, which focuses on minimizing the overall classification error, the margin-based cosine loss explicitly incorporates a margin to ensure that the model learns discriminative features.",

However, the paper does mention that the proposed approach is comparable to Graph Neural Network (GCN) architectures in terms of performance, suggesting that the computational complexity of the proposed approach is likely to be similar to that of GCNs. GCNs are typically more computationally expensive than traditional CNNs due to the need to compute the graph structure and perform graph convolutions, but they can also capture more complex relationships between body joints. Overall, the computational complexity of the proposed approach is likely to be higher than that of traditional CNNs, but lower than that of GCNs.",
        "6_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The paper does not explicitly compare the computational complexity of the proposed CNN-based approach to other state-of-the-art methods. However, based on the provided information, it is possible to make some inferences about the computational complexity of the proposed approach.\n\nThe proposed approach uses a CNN architecture to extract features from skeleton data. CNNs are typically more computationally expensive than traditional machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs) or random forests. This is because CNNs require a large number of parameters to be trained, and the training process can be computationally intensive.\n\nHowever, the proposed approach uses a relatively simple CNN architecture, which helps to reduce the computational complexity. The architecture consists of a few convolutional layers, followed by a fully connected layer. This architecture is similar to the architecture used in other CNN-based approaches to skeleton-based human action recognition.\n\nIn addition to the CNN architecture, the proposed approach also uses a number of data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotation, and cropping. These techniques help to improve the generalization performance of the model, but they can also increase the computational complexity. However, the computational cost of data augmentation is typically small compared to the cost of training the CNN model.\n\nOverall, it is likely that the computational complexity of the proposed approach is similar to that of other CNN-based approaches to skeleton-based human action recognition.
