        "summary": "This survey presents an overview of CNN architectures for human action recognition and human pose estimation from videos. The paper traces the development and adaptations of the subset of networks that have been extended for animal behavior classification. Action recognition aims to identify and classify the activity in a trimmed video. The output of an action recognition algorithm is a set of class labels for each trimmed video. When the class label is one of a set of pre-de\ufb01ned expressions that occur in response to a stimuli (behavior) [32], the task is behavior classification. Pose estimation is the task of determining a subject\u2019s position and orientation in an image frame. Pose-based action recognition methods use pose estimation predictions (image frame coordinates) to classify body movements. Pose estimation may be used to identify joint positions before classifying behavior.",
        "abstract": "Classifying the behavior of humans or animals from videos is important in biomedical fields for understanding brain function and response to stimuli. Action recognition, classifying activities performed by one or more subjects in a trimmed video, forms the basis of many of these techniques. Deep learning models for human action recognition have progressed significantly over the last decade. Recently, there is an increased interest in research that incorporates deep learning-based action recognition for animal behavior classification. However, human action recognition methods are more developed. This survey presents an overview of human action recognition and pose estimation methods that are based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and have been adapted for animal behavior classification in neuroscience. Pose estimation, estimating joint positions from an image frame, is included because it is often applied before classifying animal behavior. First, we provide foundational information on algorithms that learn spatiotemporal features through 2D, two-stream, and 3D CNNs. We explore motivating factors that determine optimizers, loss functions and training procedures, and compare their performance on benchmark datasets. Next, we review animal behavior frameworks that use or build upon these methods, organized by the level of supervision they require. Our discussion is uniquely focused on the technical evolution of the underlying CNN models and their architectural adaptations (which we illustrate), rather than their usability in a neuroscience lab. We conclude by discussing open research problems, and possible research directions. Our survey is designed to be a resource for researchers developing fully unsupervised animal behavior classification systems of which there are only a few examples in the literature.",

        "2_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "CNNs use a variety of techniques to perform action recognition and pose estimation, which can then be used to classify animal behavior. These techniques include:\n\n* **Spatial convolutions:** CNNs use spatial convolutions to identify patterns in images and videos. These convolutions are performed by applying a filter to the input data, and then summing the results. The filter is typically a small matrix of weights, and it is applied to the input data at every possible location. The output of the convolution is a new matrix of values, which represents the patterns that were detected by the filter.\n\n* **Pooling:** Pooling is a technique that is used to reduce the dimensionality of the output of a convolution. Pooling is performed by dividing the output of the convolution into a grid of cells, and then taking the maximum or average value from each cell. This reduces the number of values that need to be processed by the network, and it also helps to make the network more robust to noise.\n\n* **Fully connected layers:** Fully connected layers are used to combine the output of the convolutional and pooling layers into a single vector. This vector is then used to classify the input data.\n\nCNNs have been shown to be very effective for action recognition and pose estimation. They are able to learn complex patterns in data, and they are robust to noise and variations in the input data. This makes them well-suited for classifying animal behavior, which can be a challenging task due to the variability of animal movements and postures.",

Action recognition aims to identify and classify the activity performed by one or more subjects in a video, while pose estimation focuses on estimating the position and orientation of a subject's body joints in an image or video frame. \n\nThese two tasks are often intertwined, as body pose can provide valuable information for action recognition. For example, if you see a person's hand moving up and down, you can infer that they are waving. Conversely, action recognition can help to refine pose estimation by providing additional context and constraints on the plausible body poses. \n\nIn recent years, there has been significant progress in both action recognition and pose estimation, thanks to the development of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs are particularly well-suited for these tasks because they can learn to extract hierarchical features from images and videos, which can be used to represent body pose and action dynamics. \n\nA number of benchmark datasets have been developed for evaluating action recognition and pose estimation methods, such as the UCF101 and MPII Human Pose datasets.

Most previous works mainly focus on long-term temporal relation modeling based on high-level spatial representations, without considering the crucial low-level spatial features and short-term temporal relations. Actually, the former feature could bring rich local semantic information, and the latter feature could represent motion characteristics of adjacent frames, respectively. In this paper, we propose SloshNet, a new framework that revisits the spatial and temporal modeling for few-shot action recognition in a finer manner. First, to exploit the low-level spatial features, we design a feature fusion architecture search module to automatically search for the best combination of the low-level and high-level spatial features. Next, inspired by the recent transformer, we introduce a long-term temporal modeling module to model the global temporal relations based on the extracted spatial appearance features.

In this paper, we propose a graph contrastive learning framework for skeleton-based action recognition (\\textit{SkeletonGCL}) to explore the \\textit{global} context across all sequences. In specific, SkeletonGCL associates graph learning across sequences by enforcing graphs to be class-discriminative, \\emph{i.e.,} intra-class compact and inter-class dispersed, which improves the GCN capacity to distinguish various action patterns. Besides, two memory banks are designed to enrich cross-sequence context from two complementary levels, \\emph{i.e.,} instance and semantic levels, enabling graph contrastive learning in multiple context scales. Consequently, SkeletonGCL establishes a new training paradigm, and it can be seamlessly incorporated into current GCNs. Without loss of generality, we combine SkeletonGCL with three GCNs (2S-ACGN, CTR-GCN, and InfoGCN), and achieve consistent improvements on NTU60, NTU120, and NW-UCLA benchmarks.

SkeletonGCL, on the other hand, uses graphs to represent skeletons, which preserves the structural information. This allows SkeletonGCL to learn how to distinguish between different actions based on the way the joints are connected and move.",
        "1_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "Previous contrastive learning methods typically operate on pooled feature vectors, which aggregate information from the entire skeleton. While this approach can capture global motion patterns, it inevitably loses the fine-grained structural properties of skeletons. These structural properties, such as the relative positions and orientations of joints, are crucial for distinguishing between different actions. To address this issue, SkeletonGCL leverages graphs to represent skeletons. Graphs can explicitly encode the connectivity and spatial relationships between joints, preserving the structural information that is essential for action recognition. By contrasting graphs, SkeletonGCL can learn to differentiate between actions based on their unique structural characteristics.",

        "abstract": "For pursuing accurate skeleton-based action recognition, most prior methods use the strategy of combining Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) with attention-based methods in a serial way. However, they regard the human skeleton as a complete graph, resulting in less variations between different actions (e.g., the connection between the elbow and head in action ``clapping hands''). For this, we propose a novel Contrastive GCN-Transformer Network (ConGT) which fuses the spatial and temporal modules in a parallel way. The ConGT involves two parallel streams: Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution stream (STG) and Spatial-Temporal Transformer stream (STT). The STG is designed to obtain action representations maintaining the natural topology structure of the human skeleton. The STT is devised to acquire action representations containing the global relationships among joints. Since the action representations produced from these two streams contain different characteristics, and each of them knows little information of the other, we introduce the contrastive learning paradigm to guide their output representations of the same sample to be as close as possible in a self-supervised manner. Through the contrastive learning, they can learn information from each other to enrich the action features by maximizing the mutual information between the two types of action representations. To further improve action recognition accuracy, we introduce the Cyclical Focal Loss (CFL) which can focus on confident training samples in early training epochs, with an increasing focus on hard samples during the middle epochs. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets, which demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in action recognition.",

The network has to determine if two samples\u2014let's say two videos of people doing the same action but from different angles\u2014belong to the same class. The network learns by comparing the similarity of the features it extracts from the two samples. If the features are similar, the network knows the samples belong to the same class. This game forces the network to learn features that are important for identifying actions, even if they come from different viewpoints or perspectives.",
        "1_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "ConGT incorporates a contrastive learning paradigm, which involves two streams of feature extraction: the spatial-temporal graph convolution stream (STG) and the spatial-temporal transformer stream (STT). During training, the network learns to generate two distinct representations of the same action from the same input skeleton sequence using the STG and STT. The network then employs a contrastive loss function to minimize the distance between the two representations, maximizing their mutual information.

CNNs are more commonly used for image recognition tasks, while GCNs are specifically designed for working with graph data.In the context of skeleton-based action recognition, the human skeleton is represented as a graph, where the nodes represent the joints and the edges represent the bones.

Another challenge is that the distribution of video data is different from the distribution of image data, which can lead to the model overfitting to the video dataset and forgetting its knowledge from the image dataset.

SDS-CL presents a group of contrastive losses that thoroughly contrast features at different levels, i.e., spatial-squeezing temporal-contrasting loss at the frame level, and temporal-squeezing spatial-contrasting loss at the joint level, and global-contrasting loss at the skeleton level. SDS-CL designs a Spatiotemporal-decoupling Intra-Inter Attention (SIIA) to obtain the spatiotemporal-decoupling attentive features for capturing spatiotemporal speci\ufb01c information by calculating spatial- and temporal-decoupling intra-attention maps among joint/motion features, as well as spatial- and temporal-decoupling inter-attention maps between joint and motion features.",

However, most contrastive learning-based methods only contrast global features mixing spatiotemporal information, which confuses the spatial- and temporal-specific information reflecting different semantic at the frame level and joint level. Thus, we propose a novel Spatiotemporal Decouple-and-Squeeze Contrastive Learning (SDS-CL) framework to comprehensively learn more abundant representations of skeleton-based actions by jointly contrasting spatial-squeezing features, temporal-squeezing features, and global features. In SDS-CL, we design a new Spatiotemporal-decoupling Intra-Inter Attention (SIIA) mechanism to obtain the spatiotemporal-decoupling attentive features for capturing spatiotemporal specific information by calculating spatial- and temporal-decoupling intra-attention maps among joint/motion features, as well as spatial- and temporal-decoupling inter-attention maps between joint and motion features. Moreover, we present a new Spatial-squeezing Temporal-contrasting Loss (STL), a new Temporal-squeezing Spatial-contrasting Loss (TSL), and the Global-contrasting Loss (GL) to contrast the spatial-squeezing joint and motion features at the frame level, temporal-squeezing joint and motion features at the joint level, as well as global joint and motion features at the skeleton level.

        "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable capability in representation learning for skeleton-based action recognition. Existing methods mainly focus on applying global data augmentation to generate different views of the skeleton sequence for contrastive learning. However, due to the rich action clues in the skeleton sequences, existing methods may only take a global perspective to learn to discriminate different skeletons without thoroughly leveraging the local relationship between different skeleton joints and video frames, which is essential for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (PSTL) framework to exploit the local relationship from a partial skeleton sequences built by a unique spatio-temporal masking strategy. Specifically, we construct a negative-sample-free triplet steam structure that is composed of an anchor stream without any masking, a spatial masking stream with Central Spatial Masking (CSM), and a temporal masking stream with Motion Attention Temporal Masking (MATM). The feature cross-correlation matrix is measured between the anchor stream and the other two masking streams, respectively. (1) Central Spatial Masking discards selected joints from the feature calculation process, where the joints with a higher degree of centrality have a higher possibility of being selected. (2) Motion Attention Temporal Masking leverages the motion of action and remove frames that move faster with a higher possibility. Our method achieves SOTA performance on NTU-60, NTU-120 and PKU-MMD under various downstream tasks. A practical evaluation is performed where some skeleton joints are lost in downstream tasks. In contrast to previous methods that suffer from large performance drops, our PSTL can still achieve remarkable results, validating the robustness of our method.

The system employs various deep learning models, including ConvLSTM, LRCN, CNN-Transformer, and C3D, trained on a custom dataset of annotated videos.

        "abstract": "Real-time video surveillance, through CCTV camera systems has become essential for ensuring public safety which is a priority today. Although CCTV cameras help a lot in increasing security, these systems require constant human interaction and monitoring. To eradicate this issue, intelligent surveillance systems can be built using deep learning video classification techniques that can help us automate surveillance systems to detect violence as it happens. In this research, we explore deep learning video classification techniques to detect violence as they are happening. Traditional image classification techniques fall short when it comes to classifying videos as they attempt to classify each frame separately for which the predictions start to flicker. Therefore, many researchers are coming up with video classification techniques that consider spatiotemporal features while classifying. However, deploying these deep learning models with methods such as skeleton points obtained through pose estimation and optical flow obtained through depth sensors, are not always practical in an IoT environment. Although these techniques ensure a higher accuracy score, they are computationally heavier. Keeping these constraints in mind, we experimented with various video classification and action recognition techniques such as ConvLSTM, LRCN (with both custom CNN layers and VGG-16 as feature extractor) CNNTransformer and C3D. We achieved a test accuracy of 80% on ConvLSTM, 83.33% on CNN-BiLSTM, 70% on VGG16-BiLstm ,76.76% on CNN-Transformer and 80% on C3D.",

Can you explain the difference between these metrics and provide an example of how they can be used to evaluate a model?",
        "1_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "**Accuracy** measures how many correct predictions a model makes compared to the total number of predictions. For example, if a model predicts 10 out of 15 images correctly, the accuracy would be 10/15 = 0.67 or 67%.\n\n**F1-score** is a weighted average of precision and recall. Precision measures the proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct, and recall measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly predicted. F1-score is calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall). For example, if a model has a precision of 0.7 and a recall of 0.8, the F1-score would be 2 * (0.7 * 0.8) / (0.7 + 0.8) = 0.74.\n\n**Recall** measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly predicted. For example, if a model correctly predicts 8 out of 10 positive examples, the recall would be 8/10 = 0.8 or 80%.",
        "1_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "**Accuracy** is the most straightforward metric and is calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions. It is a good measure of overall performance, but it can be misleading if the dataset is imbalanced (i.e., if there are significantly more examples of one class than another). \n\n**F1-score** is a weighted average of precision and recall, and is calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall). It is a good measure of performance when the dataset is imbalanced, as it takes into account both the number of correct predictions and the number of false negatives and false positives. \n\n**Recall** is the proportion of actual positives that are correctly predicted, and is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of actual positives. It is a good measure of how well the model can identify all of the positive examples in the dataset. \n\nTo illustrate the difference between these metrics, consider the following example. Suppose we have a dataset of 100 images, 50 of which are positive examples and 50 of which are negative examples. A model that predicts all of the images as positive would have an accuracy of 100%, but a precision of 0% and a recall of 100%. This is because the model would correctly predict all of the positive examples, but it would also incorrectly predict all of the negative examples. A model that predicts all of the images as negative would have an accuracy of 0%, but a precision of 100% and a recall of 0%. This is because the model would incorrectly predict all of the positive examples, but it would correctly predict all of the negative examples. A model that correctly predicts 45 of the positive examples and 45 of the negative examples would have an accuracy of 90%, a precision of 90%, and a recall of 90%.

Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of TCTE-Net over existing methods on three benchmark datasets.",
        "abstract": "Skeleton-based action recognition has become popular in recent years due to its efficiency and robustness. Most current methods adopt graph convolutional network (GCN) for topology modeling, but GCN-based methods are limited in long-distance correlation modeling and generalizability. In contrast, the potential of convolutional neural network (CNN) for topology modeling has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN architecture, Temporal-Channel Topology Enhanced Network (TCTE-Net), to learn spatial and temporal topologies for skeleton-based action recognition. The TCTE-Net consists of two modules: the Temporal-Channel Focus module, which learns a temporal-channel focus matrix to identify the most critical feature representations, and the Dynamic Channel Topology Attention module, which dynamically learns spatial topological features, and fuses them with an attention mechanism to model long-distance channel-wise topology. We conduct experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and FineGym datasets. TCTE-Net shows state-of-the-art performance compared to CNN-based methods and achieves superior performance compared to GCN-based methods.

Our DMMG consists of a viewpoint variation min-max game and an edge perturbation min-max game. These two min-max games adopt an adversarial paradigm to perform data augmentation on the skeleton sequences and graph-structured body joints, respectively. Our viewpoint variation min-max game focuses on constructing various hard contrastive pairs by generating skeleton sequences from various viewpoints. These hard contrastive pairs help our model learn representative action features, thus facilitating model transfer to downstream tasks. Moreover, our edge perturbation min-max game specializes in building diverse hard contrastive samples through perturbing connectivity strength among graph-based body joints. The connectivity-strength varying contrastive pairs enable the model to capture minimal sufficient information of different actions, such as representative gestures for an action while preventing the model from overfitting. By fully exploiting the proposed DMMG, we can generate sufficient challenging contrastive pairs and thus achieve discriminative action feature representations from unlabeled skeleton data in a self-supervised manner.

The key challenge lies in collecting a sufficient number of labeled data, especially for rare driving scenes. To tackle this problem, the paper proposes a semi-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) method that leverages both labeled and unlabeled driving videos. The proposed method involves two main components: 1) Simple algorithm for Object Instance Association (SOIA) to determine distances between unlabeled videos based on object instance association, and 2) SSCL with SOIA distances to optimize the representation learning. Extensive experiments on the HDD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in ego-vehicle action recognition and significantly outperforms existing methods trained in a fully-supervised setting.",
        "abstract": "In recent years, many automobiles have been equipped with cameras, which have accumulated an enormous amount of video footage of driving scenes. Autonomous driving demands the highest level of safety, for which even unimaginably rare driving scenes have to be collected in training data to improve the recognition accuracy for specific scenes. However, it is prohibitively costly to find very few specific scenes from an enormous amount of videos. In this article, we show that proper video-to-video distances can be defined by focusing on ego-vehicle actions. It is well known that existing methods based on supervised learning cannot handle videos that do not fall into predefined classes, though they work well in defining video-to-video distances in the embedding space between labeled videos. To tackle this problem, we propose a method based on semi-supervised contrastive learning. We consider two related but distinct contrastive learning: standard graph contrastive learning and our proposed SOIA-based contrastive learning. We observe that the latter approach can provide more sensible video-to-video distances between unlabeled videos. Next, the effectiveness of our method is quantified by evaluating the classification performance of the ego-vehicle action recognition using HDD dataset, which shows that our method including unlabeled data in training significantly outperforms the existing methods using only labeled data in training.",

In this work, we aim to transfer the powerful multimodal knowledge of CLIP to alleviate the inaccurate prototype estimation issue due to data scarcity, which is a critical problem in low-shot regimes. To this end, we present a CLIP-guided prototype modulating framework called CLIP-FSAR, which consists of two key components: a video-text contrastive objective and a prototype modulation. Specifically, the former bridges the task discrepancy between CLIP and the few-shot video task by contrasting videos and corresponding class text descriptions. The latter leverages the transferable textual concepts from CLIP to adaptively refine visual prototypes with a temporal Transformer. By this means, CLIP-FSAR can take full advantage of the rich semantic priors in CLIP to obtain reliable prototypes and achieve accurate few-shot classification.

        "summary": "Human action recognition is a crucial aspect of natural human-computer interaction, and skeleton-based action recognition, in particular, has gained popularity due to its efficiency and robustness compared to other modalities such as RGB frames. However, skeleton representations often lack important contextual information, leading to ambiguities in distinguishing similar actions. This paper proposes a novel auxiliary feature re\ufb01nement head (FR Head) to address this issue. The FR Head consists of spatial-temporal decoupling and contrastive feature re\ufb01nement, which enable the model to extract more discriminative representations of skeletons. Ambiguous samples are dynamically discovered and calibrated in the feature space. Furthermore, the FR Head can be imposed on different stages of GCNs to build a multi-level re\ufb01nement for stronger supervision.

        "abstract": "Human action recognition aims at classifying the category of human action from a segment of a video. Recently, people have dived into designing GCN-based models to extract features from skeletons for performing this task, because skeleton representations are much more efficient and robust than other modalities such as RGB frames.

This allows the model to reason about the relative positions of events in both space and time.",

        "2_answers:eli5": "For action recognition, we often have long streams of events that represent an action, like waving a hand. The segment modeling strategy in EVSTr breaks down these long streams into smaller chunks or segments. Then, it applies the EVSTr encoder to each segment to capture the important features. Finally, it combines these segment-level features to understand the overall action.",
        "2_answers:expert": "The segment modeling strategy is designed for action recognition by learning the long-range temporal dynamics from a sequence of segmented features. It splits a long-duration event stream into a sequence of segmented voxel sets and extracts spatiotemporal features per segment by the encoder. Then a sequence of features is fed to a Stream-Segment Temporal Modeling Module (S2TM) for aggregating the temporal dynamics.",

        "2_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "The segment modeling strategy chops a long-duration event stream into many smaller, manageable chunks called \"segments\". Each segment contains a bunch of events that happen close together in time. The EVSTr model then uses its event voxel transformer encoder to analyze each segment separately, extracting features that capture the unique patterns of events within that segment. By doing this for all the segments, the model learns how the patterns change over time, which helps it recognize different actions.",
        "2_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The segment modeling strategy in EVSTr plays a crucial role in enabling action recognition by learning temporal dependencies from input sequences. Here's how it works: \n\n1. **Segmentation**: A long-duration event stream is divided into a series of shorter segments. Each segment represents a portion of the action being performed.\n\n2. **Event Voxel Transformer Encoder**: Each segment is processed individually by the event voxel transformer encoder. This encoder extracts spatiotemporal features from the events within the segment, capturing the patterns and dynamics of the action.\n\n3. **Stream-Segment Temporal Modeling Module (S2TM)**: The extracted features from each segment are fed into the S2TM. This module learns the temporal relationships between the segments, effectively capturing the evolution of the action over time.\n\n4. **Action Classification**: The S2TM's output is then transformed into a class label, enabling the model to recognize the specific action being performed.\n\nThe segment modeling strategy allows EVSTr to break down complex actions into smaller, manageable units. By analyzing the temporal dependencies between these segments, the model can learn the subtle patterns and dynamics that differentiate different actions, resulting in accurate action recognition.",

It then uses the EVSTr encoder to extract features from each segment, sort of like summarizing each clip. After that, it combines these summaries from all the segments to get a better understanding of the whole event stream, like watching a movie trailer before seeing the full movie.",

A Stream-Segment Temporal Modeling Module (S2TM) is designed to learn long-range temporal dynamics from the sequence of segmented features. The S2TM consists of a classification token and a set of segment features. The classification token is initialized with learnable parameters and serves as a global representation of the event stream. During training, the classification token attends to the segment features and updates its representation to capture the temporal context. The updated classification token is then used to predict the action category.",

First, it adopts the event voxel set representation, which retains the sparse and asynchronous nature of events while maintaining local semantics. In contrast, previous models often convert events into dense frames, leading to redundant computation and reduced temporal resolution. Second, EVSTr employs a novel event voxel transformer encoder with two key components: Multi-Scale Neighbor Embedding Layer (MNEL) and Voxel Self-Attention Layer (VSAL). The MNEL layer jointly models positional and semantic relations for attentive multi-scale feature aggregation, while the VSAL layer enables global feature interactions by computing semantic correlations between voxels.

MAXI demonstrates significant improvements over the base VL model performance on zero-shot action recognition tasks, and even compares favorably to fully-supervised baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot video recognition transfer.",
        "abstract": "Large scale Vision-Language (VL) models have shown tremendous success in aligning representations between visual and text modalities. This enables remarkable progress in zero-shot recognition, image generation & editing, and many other exciting tasks. However, VL models tend to over-represent objects while paying much less attention to verbs, and require additional tuning on video data for best zero-shot action recognition performance. While previous work relied on large-scale, fully-annotated data, in this work we propose an unsupervised approach. We adapt a VL model for zero-shot and few-shot action recognition using a collection of unlabeled videos and an unpaired action dictionary. Based on that, we leverage Large Language Models and VL models to build a text bag for each unlabeled video via matching, text expansion and captioning. We use those bags in a Multiple Instance Learning setup to adapt an image-text backbone to video data. Although finetuned on unlabeled video data, our resulting models demonstrate high transferability to numerous unseen zero-shot downstream tasks, improving the base VL model performance by up to 14\\%, and even comparing favorably to fully-supervised baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot video recognition transfer.

        "0_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "MAXI uses a bunch of different ways to understand what's going on in a video, even if it doesn't have any labels. It starts by matching each video with text descriptions, then uses a special language model to expand those descriptions and come up with more words that describe the actions. Finally, it uses a computer vision model to create a text bag for each video, which is a collection of all the possible words that could describe the actions. This helps the computer vision model to better understand the actions in the video, even if it has never seen them before.",
        "0_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "MAXI leverages three main language sources to improve zero-shot action recognition: 1) a predefined action dictionary containing potential action labels, 2) a large language model (LLM) for text expansion, and 3) a vision-language model (VL) for video captioning. The action dictionary provides a coarse prior knowledge of the potential action types in the unlabeled video collection. The LLM is used to expand the text bag by generating alternative descriptions of the action, providing details that are hallucinated based on the LLM's world knowledge. The VL model is employed for generating frame captions, which provide instance-level descriptions that are dependent on the visual content of frames in the unlabeled videos. By combining these different language sources, MAXI enriches the text bags with diverse and informative descriptions of the actions in the videos, enabling the downstream VL model to better understand and recognize the actions in zero-shot transfer tasks.",

EgoViT takes into account the hand-object information, which is not considered by previous transformers; We propose a dynamic class token generator (DCTG) producing the CT, carrying EAR-related information based on the content of each input, instead of the static CT used by previous transformers. Dynamic CT can guide the model to focus on informative parts of the video; Considering the large camera movement in egocentric videos, we construct the transformer by a Pyramid Architecture with a Dynamic Merging (PADM) module, which can properly model the temporal structure and dynamically distribute weights to each temporal component; We conduct extensive experiments to show that our proposed EgoViT can boost the performance of various transformers for EAR while reducing the computations at the same time.",
        "abstract": "Capturing interaction of hands with objects is important to autonomously detect human actions from egocentric videos. In this work, we present a pyramid video transformer with a dynamic class token generator for egocentric action recognition. Different from previous video transformers, which use the same static embedding as the class token for diverse inputs, we propose a dynamic class token generator that produces a class token for each input video by analyzing the hand-object interaction and the related motion information. The dynamic class token can diffuse such information to the entire model by communicating with other informative tokens in the subsequent transformer layers. With the dynamic class token, dissimilarity between videos can be more prominent, which helps the model distinguish various inputs. In addition, traditional video transformers explore temporal features globally, which requires large amounts of computation. However, egocentric videos often have a large amount of background scene transition, which causes discontinuities across distant frames. In this case, blindly reducing the temporal sampling rate will risk losing crucial information. Hence, we also propose a pyramid architecture to hierarchically process the video from short-term high rate to long-term low rate. With the proposed architecture, we significantly reduce the computational cost as well as the memory requirement without sacrificing from the model performance. We perform comparisons with different baseline video transformers on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and EGTEA Gaze+ datasets. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that the proposed model can efficiently improve the performance for egocentric action recognition.",

        "title": "Video Action Recognition with Attentive Semantic Units",
        "summary": "This paper introduces a novel method for video action recognition that utilizes attentive semantic units to guide the representation learning of videos. The proposed method leverages semantic units extracted from the language descriptions of the action set, including body parts, objects, scenes, and motions, to establish fine-grained and specific guidance for visual alignments. To effectively incorporate the semantic units, a multi-region attention module is introduced upon the visual encoder to perceive region-aware visual features. These features are then used to select relevant semantic units with a cross-modal decoder, which in turn guides the decoding of spatiotemporal video representations. The experimental results on the Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, HMDB-51, and UCF-101 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both fully-supervised and few-shot learning settings.",
        "abstract": "Visual-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly advanced action video recognition. Supervised by the semantics of action labels, recent works adapt the visual branch of VLMs to learn video representations. Despite the effectiveness proved by these works, we believe that the potential of VLMs has yet to be fully harnessed. In light of this, we exploit the semantic units (SU) hiding behind the action labels and leverage their correlations with fine-grained items in frames for more accurate action recognition. SUs are entities extracted from the language descriptions of the entire action set, including body parts, objects, scenes, and motions. To further enhance the alignments between visual contents and the SUs, we introduce a multi-region module (MRA) to the visual branch of the VLM. The MRA allows the perception of region-aware visual features beyond the original global feature. Our method adaptively attends to and selects relevant SUs with visual features of frames. With a cross-modal decoder, the selected SUs serve to decode spatiotemporal video representations. In summary, the SUs as the medium can boost discriminative ability and transferability. Specifically, in fully-supervised learning, our method achieved 87.8% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400.

        "title": "Dual-path Adaptation from Image to Video Transformers",
        "summary": "This paper proposes a novel parameter-ef\ufb01cient transfer learning method for video understanding, namely DUALPATH, which consists of two distinct paths (spatial path and temporal path). For both paths, we freeze the pretrained image model and train only additional bottleneck adapters for tuning. The spatial path is designed to encode the spatial contexts that can be inferred from the appearance of individual frames with the minimum tuning of the pretrained image model. To reduce the computation burden, we sparsely use the frames with a low frame rate in the spatial path. The temporal path corresponds to the temporal context that should be encoded by grasping the dynamic relationship over several frames sampled with a high frame rate. Especially for two reasons, we construct a grid-like frameset that consists of consecutive low-resolution frames as an input of the temporal path: (i) preventing computational efficiency loss caused by calculating multiple frames simultaneously; (ii) precisely imitating the ViT\u2019s ability for extrapolating global dependencies between input tokens. To compare our DUALPATH with existing methods broadly, we implement several baselines with a uni\ufb01ed perspective on recent domain-speci\ufb01c PETL approaches [11, 37, 54]. Extensive experiments on several action recognition benchmarks [24, 40, 41, 44] demonstrate the effectiveness and high efficiency of our DUALPATH, achieving comparable and even better performance than the baselines and prior video models [1, 7, 19, 23, 42, 45, 50, 62, 73, 81]. We achieve these results with extremely low computational costs for both training and inference, as demonstrated in Fig. 1.",

Previous adaptation methods have simultaneously considered spatial and temporal modeling with a unified learnable module but still suffered from fully leveraging the representative capabilities of image transformers. We argue that the popular dual-path (two-stream) architecture in video models can mitigate this problem. We propose a novel DualPath adaptation separated into spatial and temporal adaptation paths, where a lightweight bottleneck adapter is employed in each transformer block. Especially for temporal dynamic modeling, we incorporate consecutive frames into a grid-like frameset to precisely imitate vision transformers' capability that extrapolates relationships between tokens. In addition, we extensively investigate the multiple baselines from a unified perspective in video understanding and compare them with DualPath. Experimental results on four action recognition benchmarks prove that pretrained image transformers with DualPath can be effectively generalized beyond the data domain.",

Unlike previous approaches that rely primarily on spatial augmentation and statistical alignment at the instance level, this paper proposes a novel method called SSA2lign that addresses FSVDA at the snippet level. SSA2lign employs a simple yet effective stochastic sampling process to augment the target domain data and performs semantic alignment from three perspectives: alignment based on the semantic information within each snippet, cross-snippets of each video, and across snippet-level data distribution. Extensive experiments show that SSA2lign achieves a significant average improvement over current state-of-the-art FSDA/FSVDA methods on two large-scale cross-domain action recognition benchmarks.",

We thus consider a more realistic \\textit{Few-Shot Video-based Domain Adaptation} (FSVDA) scenario where we adapt video models with only a few target video samples. While a few methods have touched upon Few-Shot Domain Adaptation (FSDA) in images and in FSVDA, they rely primarily on spatial augmentation for target domain expansion with alignment performed statistically at the instance level. However, videos contain more knowledge in terms of rich temporal and semantic information, which should be fully considered while augmenting target domains and performing alignment in FSVDA. We propose a novel SSA2lign to address FSVDA at the snippet level, where the target domain is expanded through a simple snippet-level augmentation followed by the attentive alignment of snippets both semantically and statistically, where semantic alignment of snippets is conducted through multiple perspectives. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SSA2lign across multiple cross-domain action recognition benchmarks.",

These actionlets are then used to guide the feature pooling process. By utilizing the semantic information of the actionlets, the SAFP method can effectively aggregate the features from the motion-related regions, while suppressing the features from the static regions. This leads to a more discriminative feature representation for action recognition.",

        "summary": "This paper proposes an automatic evaluation method for classifying herding behavior in underwater videos captured by a camera mounted on a remotely controlled trawl. The method employs convolutional and attention-based deep learning networks trained end-to-end on a small dataset of video sequences labeled by an expert in fishing technology. The trained models achieve reasonable accuracy in classifying the presence of a fish and its reaction to directed laser light. However, an inspection of the activation maps learned by the models raises concerns about the models' reliance on scene attributes unrelated to fish behavior, such as the position of laser lines in the video frames. This finding underscores the importance of careful experimental design and model interpretation when using deep learning for scientific data evaluation.",
        "abstract": "This paper considers the automatic classification of herding behavior in the cluttered low-visibility environment that typically surrounds towed fishing gear. The paper compares three convolutional and attention-based deep action recognition network architectures trained end-to-end on a small set of video sequences captured by a remotely controlled camera and classified by an expert in fishing technology. The sequences depict a scene in front of a fishing trawl where the conventional herding mechanism has been replaced by directed laser light. The goal is to detect the presence of a fish in the sequence and classify whether or not the fish reacts to the lasers. A two-stream CNN model, a CNN-transformer hybrid, and a pure transformer model were trained end-to-end to achieve 63%, 54%, and 60% 10-fold classification accuracy on the three-class task when compared to the human expert. Inspection of the activation maps learned by the three networks raises questions about the attributes of the sequences the models may be learning, specifically whether changes in viewpoint introduced by human camera operators that affect the position of laser lines in the video frames may interfere with the classification. This underlines the importance of careful experimental design when capturing scientific data for automatic end-to-end evaluation and the usefulness of inspecting the trained models.",

        "summary": "The provided research introduces BEAR (BEnchmark on video Action Recognition), a novel and thorough benchmark for evaluating spatiotemporal representation learning techniques. BEAR includes 18 video datasets covering a wide range of real-world applications, including anomaly detection, gesture recognition, daily activities, sports, and instructional tasks. This benchmark enables researchers to assess models' effectiveness under various conditions, including standard fine-tuning, few-shot fine-tuning, unsupervised domain adaptation, and zero-shot learning. The benchmark's creators offer a comprehensive analysis of six representative video models pre-trained using both supervised and self-supervised methods. Their findings challenge the notion that transformer-based models consistently outperform 2D CNNs. They also highlight the susceptibility of self-supervised pre-training to domain shifts and the significant impact of viewpoint changes on downstream task performance. The authors conclude that current state-of-the-art models may not reliably guarantee high performance on datasets close to real-world applications, emphasizing the need for a fair and challenging evaluation benchmark like BEAR to guide the development of next-generation spatiotemporal learners.",
        "abstract": "The goal of building a benchmark (suite of datasets) is to provide a unified protocol for fair evaluation and thus facilitate the evolution of a specific area. Nonetheless, we point out that existing protocols of action recognition could yield partial evaluations due to several limitations. To comprehensively probe the effectiveness of spatiotemporal representation learning, we introduce BEAR, a new BEnchmark on video Action Recognition. BEAR is a collection of 18 video datasets grouped into 5 categories (anomaly, gesture, daily, sports, and instructional), which covers a diverse set of real-world applications. With BEAR, we thoroughly evaluate 6 common spatiotemporal models pre-trained by both supervised and self-supervised learning. We also report transfer performance via standard finetuning, few-shot finetuning, and unsupervised domain adaptation. Our observation suggests that current state-of-the-art cannot solidly guarantee high performance on datasets close to real-world applications, and we hope BEAR can serve as a fair and challenging evaluation benchmark to gain insights on building next-generation spatiotemporal learners.

We split action sequences into temporal blocks, Higher-order Transformer (HoT) produces embeddings of each temporal block based on (i) the body joints, (ii) pairwise links of body joints and (iii) higher-order hyper-edges of skeleton body joints. We combine such HoT embeddings of hyper-edges of orders 1, ..., r by a novel Multi-order Multi-mode Transformer (3Mformer) with two modules whose order can be exchanged to achieve coupled-mode attention on coupled-mode tokens based on 'channel-temporal block', 'order-channel-body joint', 'channel-hyper-edge (any order)' and 'channel-only' pairs. The first module, called Multi-order Pooling (MP), additionally learns weighted aggregation along the hyper-edge mode, whereas the second module, Temporal block Pooling (TP), aggregates along the temporal block mode.

Estimate the anomaly score using this distribution in the inference phase.\n\n3. **Inference:** Introduce a similarity score between the user prompt embeddings and skeleton features aligned in the common space into the anomaly score. This indirectly supplements normal actions.\n\n**Results:** The proposed method demonstrates:\n\n- Elimination of DNN training with normal samples via pretrained skeleton feature representations.\n- Effective modeling of the distributions of normal and abnormal actions using the zero-shot learning paradigm in the context of vision and language.\n- Enhanced robustness against skeleton errors using the permutation-invariant architecture that sparsely propagates features between joints.",
        "abstract": "This study investigates unsupervised anomaly action recognition, which identifies video-level abnormal-human-behavior events in an unsupervised manner without abnormal samples, and simultaneously addresses three limitations in the conventional skeleton-based approaches: target domain-dependent DNN training, robustness against skeleton errors, and a lack of normal samples. We present a unified, user prompt-guided zero-shot learning framework using a target domain-independent skeleton feature extractor, which is pretrained on a large-scale action recognition dataset. Particularly, during the training phase using normal samples, the method models the distribution of skeleton features of the normal actions while freezing the weights of the DNNs and estimates the anomaly score using this distribution in the inference phase. Additionally, to increase robustness against skeleton errors, we introduce a DNN architecture inspired by a point cloud deep learning paradigm, which sparsely propagates the features between joints. Furthermore, to prevent the unobserved normal actions from being misidentified as abnormal actions, we incorporate a similarity score between the user prompt embeddings and skeleton features aligned in the common space into the anomaly score, which indirectly supplements normal actions. On two publicly available datasets, we conduct experiments to test the effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to abovementioned limitations.",

Structured Keypoint Pooling can recognize a wider variety of actions, including those performed by multiple people or interacting with objects. This is because the method uses a point cloud deep-learning paradigm, which is not constrained by the structure of the input data.\n\n* **Efficiency:** Structured Keypoint Pooling is more efficient than conventional skeleton-based methods. This is because the method uses a sparse feature aggregation structure, which reduces the computational cost.",

Specifically, given a video instance xi, the model generates multiple augmented views \u03c8(xi; a) using a set of predefined data augmentation transformations A. The model then encodes these augmented views using a feature extractor f to obtain feature representations zi = f(\u03c8(xi; \u00b7)). The InfoNCE loss is formulated as follows:\n\n```\nLq = -log (exp(zi \u00b7 zp/\u03c4) / (exp(zi \u00b7 zp/\u03c4) + \u03a3n\u0338=i exp(zi \u00b7 zn/\u03c4)))\n```\n\nwhere zi and zp are feature representations of augmented views of the same video instance, zn are feature representations of augmented views of different video instances, and \u03c4 is a temperature parameter.

        "4_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The proposed PSL method distinguishes itself from existing OSAR methods through several key advantages:\n\n1. **Enlarged Instance-Specific (IS) Information**: By introducing the Prototypical Similarity Learning (PSL) framework, PSL explicitly encourages the retention of IS information within the same class. This is achieved by setting a similarity threshold between the sample feature and its corresponding class prototype, which prevents the collapse of feature representations and preserves the unique characteristics of each sample.\n\n2. **Enlarged Class-Specific (CS) Information**: PSL incorporates video shuffling as a technique to enhance CS information. By introducing shuffled video samples as soft positive samples, PSL forces the network to learn distinct temporal information between original and shuffled videos. This helps the network extract more discriminative features that can distinguish between classes with similar appearances but different actions.\n\n3. **Unified Framework**: PSL seamlessly integrates the concepts of IS and CS information enlargement into a unified framework. This allows for the optimization of both aspects simultaneously, leading to a more comprehensive and effective approach to OSAR.\n\nThese advantages collectively contribute to PSL's superior performance in open-set action recognition tasks, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones.",

Open-set action recognition is the task of recognizing actions that are not included in the training set. This is a challenging task because the system must be able to generalize to new actions that it has never seen before.

If you use a traditional classification method, it might not be able to correctly classify images of other animals, like lions or elephants. However, the proposed method can learn to identify images of other animals even if it has not seen them during training.

        "summary": "This paper introduces a new method for semi-supervised action recognition called TimeBalance. TimeBalance uses two types of self-supervised video representations: temporally-invariant and temporally-distinctive. These representations are learned by training two teacher models on unlabeled data, and then using the predictions of these teachers to train a student model on labeled data. The student model is trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised losses, where the supervised loss is computed using the ground-truth labels, and the unsupervised loss is computed using the predictions of the teacher models. The unsupervised loss is weighted based on the similarity between the input video and the videos used to train the teacher models. This weighting scheme allows the student model to learn from both types of self-supervised representations, depending on the nature of the input video.",
        "abstract": "Semi-Supervised Learning can be more beneficial for the video domain compared to images because of its higher annotation cost and dimensionality. Besides, any video understanding task requires reasoning over both spatial and temporal dimensions. In order to learn both the static and motion related features for the semi-supervised action recognition task, existing methods rely on hard input inductive biases like using two-modalities (RGB and Optical-flow) or two-stream of different playback rates. Instead of utilizing unlabeled videos through diverse input streams, we rely on self-supervised video representations, particularly, we utilize temporally-invariant and temporally-distinctive representations. We observe that these representations complement each other depending on the nature of the action. Based on this observation, we propose a student-teacher semi-supervised learning framework, TimeBalance, where we distill the knowledge from a temporally-invariant and a temporally-distinctive teacher. Depending on the nature of the unlabeled video, we dynamically combine the knowledge of these two teachers based on a novel temporal similarity-based reweighting scheme.

Sequence-based video tasks, such as action recognition, use a video backbone to directly extract spatiotemporal features, while frame-based video tasks, such as multiple object tracking (MOT), rely on single fixed-image backbone to extract spatial features. In contrast, we propose to unify video understanding tasks into one novel streaming video architecture, referred to as Streaming Vision Transformer (S-ViT). S-ViT first produces frame-level features with a memory-enabled temporally-aware spatial encoder to serve the frame-based video tasks.

        "summary": "This paper presents a novel decoupled one-stage network (DOAD) for spatio-temporal action detection. DOAD decouples detection and action recognition into two branches to address the different desired properties of context representation for each task. In the detection branch, a temporal aggregation module enhances the keyframe features by aggregating adjacent frame features. In the action branch, a transformer-based module (TransPC) models pairwise relationships between people and context to capture interaction representation. DOAD achieves competitive performance with two-stage state-of-the-art methods with significant efficiency improvement.",
        "abstract": "Localizing people and recognizing their actions from videos is a challenging task towards high-level video understanding. Existing methods are mostly two-stage based, with one stage for person bounding box generation and the other stage for action recognition. However, such two-stage methods are generally with low efficiency. We observe that directly unifying detection and action recognition normally suffers from (i) inferior learning due to different desired properties of context representation for detection and action recognition; (ii) optimization difficulty with insufficient training data. In this work, we present a decoupled one-stage network dubbed DOAD, to mitigate above issues and improve the efficiency for spatio-temporal action detection. To achieve it, we decouple detection and action recognition into two branches. Specifically, one branch focuses on detection representation for actor detection, and the other one for action recognition. For the action branch, we design a transformer-based module (TransPC) to model pairwise relationships between people and context. Different from commonly used vector-based dot product in self-attention, it is built upon a novel matrix-based key and value for Hadamard attention to model person-context information. It not only exploits relationships between person pairs but also takes into account context and relative position information. The results on AVA and UCF101-24 datasets show that our method is competitive with two-stage state-of-the-art methods with significant efficiency improvement.",

This approach is less efficient. The proposed decoupled one-stage network addresses this issue by using a single stage to detect people and recognize their actions. This approach is more efficient and achieves comparable performance to two-stage methods.",
        "0_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The proposed decoupled one-stage network differs from previous methods for spatio-temporal action detection in several key aspects:\n\n1. **Architecture:** Previous methods typically adopt a two-stage framework, where person bounding boxes are first generated by an off-the-shelf detector and then classified for action recognition. In contrast, the proposed method employs a decoupled one-stage architecture, which unifies detection and action recognition into a single backbone. This design ensures that detection and action recognition learn their own optimal context support, leading to improved performance.\n\n2. **Context representation:** Detection and action recognition have different desired properties for context representation. Detection benefits from incorporating context features that support bounding box regression but is not sensitive to interactions. Action recognition, on the other hand, requires fusing corresponding entity features (e.g., other people or objects) from context to construct various interaction relationships. The decoupled architecture allows the detection and action branches to learn their own tailored context representations, addressing this disparity.\n\n3. **Transformer-based action recognition:** Previous methods for action recognition often model person-person or person-context relationships independently, neglecting the correlation among person features, context, and relative position information. The proposed method introduces a novel transformer-based module, TransPC, which explicitly integrates person and context features with relative position information for action recognition. TransPC captures pairwise person relationships upon their holistic spatial structure, retaining the context and relative position information, leading to more accurate action prediction.\n\nThese key differences contribute to the effectiveness of the proposed decoupled one-stage network for spatio-temporal action detection, enabling it to achieve competitive performance with two-stage state-of-the-art methods while maintaining significantly improved efficiency.",

However, learning such encoders without labels continues to be a challenging problem. While prior works have shown promising results by applying contrastive learning to pose sequences, the quality of the learned representations is often observed to be closely tied to data augmentations that are used to craft the positives. However, augmenting pose sequences is a difficult task as the geometric constraints among the skeleton joints need to be enforced to make the augmentations realistic for that action.

        "summary": "This paper presents Focalized Contrastive View-invariant Learning (FoCoViL), a self-supervised framework for skeleton-based action recognition. FoCoViL consists of two complementary components: contrastive view-invariant learning (CoViL) and focalization. CoViL explores the implicit relationship between viewpoints by maximizing the mutual information between multi-view action pairs under different viewpoints, such that the learned representation is robust to view changes. Focalization enhances the latent space by adaptively \"focalizing\" both the hard positives and negatives under the learned representative similarity. This reduces the weightings of easy pairs that provided limited information while focusing on pushing hard negative pairs away and pulling hard positives closer, thereby enforcing a more distinct decision boundary in the latent space. Experiments show that FoCoViL outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised models on five benchmark 3D action datasets, and produces a more robust latent space.",
        "abstract": "Learning view-invariant representation is a key to improving feature discrimination power for skeleton-based action recognition. Existing approaches cannot effectively remove the impact of viewpoint due to the implicit view-dependent representations. In this work, we propose a self-supervised framework called Focalized Contrastive View-invariant Learning (FoCoViL), which significantly suppresses the view-specific information on the representation space where the viewpoints are coarsely aligned. By maximizing mutual information with an effective contrastive loss between multi-view sample pairs, FoCoViL associates actions with common view-invariant properties and simultaneously separates the dissimilar ones. We further propose an adaptive focalization method based on pairwise similarity to enhance contrastive learning for a clearer cluster boundary in the learned space. Different from many existing self-supervised representation learning work that rely heavily on supervised classifiers, FoCoViL performs well on both unsupervised and supervised classifiers with superior recognition performance. Extensive experiments also show that the proposed contrastive-based focalization generates a more discriminative latent representation.",

However, they generally suffer from two limitations: i) the matching procedure between local frames tends to be inaccurate due to the lack of guidance to force long-range temporal perception; ii) explicit motion learning is usually ignored, leading to partial information loss. To address these issues, we develop a Motion-augmented Long-short Contrastive Learning (MoLo) method that contains two crucial components, including a long-short contrastive objective and a motion autodecoder. Specifically, the long-short contrastive objective is to endow local frame features with long-form temporal awareness by maximizing their agreement with the global token of videos belonging to the same class. The motion autodecoder is a lightweight architecture to reconstruct pixel motions from the differential features, which explicitly embeds the network with motion dynamics. By this means, MoLo can simultaneously learn long-range temporal context and motion cues for comprehensive few-shot matching. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we evaluate MoLo on five standard benchmarks, and the results show that MoLo favorably outperforms recent advanced methods.

You want to train a computer to recognize these actions in new videos, but some of the new videos show actions that the computer hasn't seen before, like juggling or ice skating. This is called open-set unsupervised video domain adaptation (OUVDA). \n\nPrior methods try to guess the new actions based on the actions the computer has seen before, or they just put all the new actions into a single \"unknown\" category. This doesn't work very well. \n\nAutoLabel is a new method that helps the computer learn the new actions without any hints. It does this by looking at the objects and actors in the videos and using them to create new action names. For example, if a video shows a person riding a horse, AutoLabel might create the new action name \"person riding horse\". \n\nThis helps the computer to better recognize the new actions and separate them from the actions it has seen before.

Unlike prior OUVDA methods that rely on specialized open-set classifiers or weighted adversarial learning strategies, AutoLabel automatically discovers and generates candidate target-private class names, which are then used by CLIP to potentially identify the target-private instances in a zero-shot manner. \n\nSpecifically, AutoLabel uses an external pre-trained image captioning model ViLT to extract a set of attribute names from every frame in a video sequence. These attributes are then used to construct a set of candidate target-private class names that best represent the true target-private class names in the target dataset at hand. \n\nThis approach differs from prior methods in several ways: \n\n- **Leveraging LVMs:** AutoLabel leverages the powerful representation learning capabilities of LVMs like CLIP, which are trained on web-scale image-text pairs and have been shown to perform well on a variety of vision tasks, including action recognition. \n\n- **Automatic label discovery:** AutoLabel automatically discovers candidate target-private class names, without relying on oracle knowledge about the target-private class names.

To understand what is happening, you need to observe not only the players' body movements but also the ball and the field.

This allows the model to reason about the interactions between people and objects, and to learn more discriminative features for action recognition.",
        "2_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The LART approach achieves significant gains compared to the dominant paradigm by leveraging the following key insights:\n\n1. **3D Tracking and Pose Cues**: The LART approach utilizes 3D tracking and pose cues to capture the temporal evolution of human motion and interactions. This provides a more complete and accurate representation of human actions than traditional 2D bounding boxes or keypoints.\n\n2. **Lagrangian Viewpoint**: By adopting the Lagrangian viewpoint, LART focuses on analyzing the trajectory of entities (e.g., humans) over time rather than at fixed points in space. This allows the model to reason about the sequence of actions and interactions, capturing the dynamics and context of human behavior.\n\n3. **Transformer Architecture**: LART employs a transformer architecture to model the relationships and interactions between different entities in the scene. Transformers have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing long-range dependencies and complex relationships, making them well-suited for action recognition tasks.\n\n4. **Fusion of Appearance and Pose Features**: LART fuses appearance features from contextualized image regions with 3D pose features, providing a comprehensive representation of both the visual and geometric aspects of human actions. This fusion enables the model to leverage complementary information from different modalities, leading to improved performance.\n\n5. **Person-Person Interactions**: LART explicitly models the interactions between different people in the scene by considering the trajectories and actions of multiple individuals simultaneously. This allows the model to capture the collaborative and competitive behaviors that often occur in social interactions.\n\nBy combining these insights, LART achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging action recognition datasets, outperforming previous approaches that rely solely on appearance or pose information.",

        "3_additional_breath_q:follow up question": "What are the key advantages of using contextualized appearance information in addition to 3D pose for action recognition?",
        "3_additional_breath_q:answers:eli5": "While understanding human actions requires interpreting multiple sources of information, some actions can be recognized by pose and pose dynamics alone. In action recognition using 3D pose, we use sophisticated human body models (like SMPL) to understand the orientation and movement of the body and its different parts. This approach can yield reasonable performance on tasks such as walking, running, or jumping, where the action is primarily characterized by the body's pose and motion. However, for more complex actions, such as preparing a meal, giving a speech, or having a conversation, we need to look beyond just the body's pose and consider the context and appearance of the scene. Contextualized appearance information, like the surrounding objects, the scene layout, and the interactions with other people, can provide valuable cues for understanding the action. Therefore, in addition to 3D pose, fusing it with contextualized appearance information obtained from deep learning models trained on large image datasets can significantly improve action recognition performance and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the action.",
        "3_additional_breath_q:answers:expert": "In addition to 3D pose, using contextualized appearance information for action recognition offers several key advantages: \n\n1. **Scene and Object Understanding**: Contextualized appearance provides information about the scene and objects in the environment, which can be crucial for understanding certain actions. For example, in a cooking scene, the presence of a stove, utensils, and ingredients can help identify the action as 'cooking.' \n\n2. **Human-Object Interactions**: Contextualized appearance can capture interactions between humans and objects, which are essential for recognizing actions like 'using a tool' or 'playing an instrument.' 3D pose alone may not provide sufficient cues for such interactions. \n\n3. **Disambiguation**: Contextualized appearance can help disambiguate actions that have similar poses but occur in different contexts. For instance, 'walking' and 'running' may have similar body movements, but the scene context (e.g., a track or a park) can help distinguish them. \n\n4. **Complementary Information**: Contextualized appearance provides complementary information to 3D pose, enriching the model's understanding of the action. By combining both sources, the model can leverage the strengths of each representation for more accurate and comprehensive action recognition. ",

        "6_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "One of the challenges of training a human action recognition model with limited labeled data is that the model may not be able to generalize well to new situations.

Another challenge is that the model may be biased towards the actions that it has seen more often in the training data.

        "abstract": "Fully supervised action segmentation works on frame-wise action recognition with dense annotations and often suffers from the over-segmentation issue. Existing works have proposed a variety of solutions such as boundary-aware networks, multi-stage refinement, and temporal smoothness losses. However, most of them take advantage of frame-wise supervision, which cannot effectively tackle the evaluation metrics with different granularities. In this paper, for the desirable large receptive field, we first develop a novel local-global attention mechanism with temporal pyramid dilation and temporal pyramid pooling for efficient multi-scale attention. Then we decouple two inherent goals in action segmentation, ie, (1) individual identification solved by frame-wise supervision, and (2) temporal reasoning tackled by action set prediction. Afterward, an action alignment module fuses these different granularity predictions, leading to more accurate and smoother action segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, eg, 82.8% (+2.6%) on GTEA and 74.7% (+1.2%) on Breakfast, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method, accompanied by extensive ablation studies. The code will be made available later.",

The action alignment module is like asking the kids what they're doing, which is a more accurate and efficient way to get the information you need. It takes the predictions from the individual identification module, which is like watching the kids play, and aligns them with the predictions from the temporal reasoning module, which is like asking the kids what they're doing.

        "summary": "This paper aims to find a balance between zero-shot and supervised video classification by adapting the pretrained CLIP model. The authors propose a multimodal prompting scheme that works on both the vision and text sides of the CLIP model. This approach allows the model to learn the temporal information in videos, as well as the data distribution of the video and text datasets. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on three video classification datasets while remaining competitive in the supervised setting.",
        "abstract": "Adopting contrastive image-text pretrained models like CLIP towards video classification has gained attention due to its cost-effectiveness and competitive performance. However, recent works in this area face a trade-off. Finetuning the pretrained model to achieve strong supervised performance results in low zero-shot generalization. Similarly, freezing the backbone to retain zero-shot capability causes significant drop in supervised accuracy. Because of this, recent works in literature typically train separate models for supervised and zero-shot action recognition. In this work, we propose a multimodal prompt learning scheme that works to balance the supervised and zero-shot performance under a single unified training. Our prompting approach on the vision side caters for three aspects: 1) Global video-level prompts to model the data distribution; 2) Local frame-level prompts to provide per-frame discriminative conditioning; and 3) a summary prompt to extract a condensed video representation. Additionally, we define a prompting scheme on the text side to augment the textual context. Through this prompting scheme, we can achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on Kinetics-600, HMDB51 and UCF101 while remaining competitive in the supervised setting. By keeping the pretrained backbone frozen, we optimize a much lower number of parameters and retain the existing general representation which helps achieve the strong zero-shot performance.

These actions are in turn composable into sequences constituting activities. We then have the hierarchy of representation illustrated in Figure 2.\n\n* **Rule-based reasoning:** Therbligs enable the imposing of a contact-based logic defining preconditions and postconditions in the form of states of contact before and after Therbligs. For example, an object being moved must be preceded by grasp and proceeded by a release. The rules of this logic interface at the Therblig level of the hierarchy.\n\n* **Resolution of semantic ambiguity:** Therbligs exhibit semantic mutual exclusivity in that there is one and only one Therblig interpretation of a sequence, as opposed to the many interpretations when action labels are intuited, leading to semantic ambiguity. As a consequence of Therbligs, semantic ambiguity at the action-level is constrained by the deeper grounding of action labels in explicit action dynamics (see Figure 2).\n\n* **Contact-centered precision of temporal boundaries of action:** Contact transitions demarcate Therblig boundaries, giving Therbligs a consistency which methods relying on annotators\u2019 intuited demarcations lack. Between points of contact exist contact states represented by a binary class (contact, no contact) for each object present, which are wholly captured by Therbligs.

Existing methods mainly rely on random appearance perturbation to indirectly pursue semantic perturbations, but this approach has limitations: 1) solely perturbing appearance cannot well capture the intrinsic semantic information of skeletons, and 2) random perturbation may change the original positive/negative pairs to soft positive/negative ones. To address these problems, we propose an attack-based augmentation scheme that additionally brings in direct semantic perturbation, for constructing hard positive pairs and further assisting in constructing hard negative pairs. Specifically, we propose a novel Attack-Augmentation Mixing-Contrastive learning (A2MC) to contrast hard positive features and hard negative features for learning more robust skeleton representations. In A2MC, Attack-Augmentation (Att-Aug) is designed to collaboratively perform targeted and untargeted perturbations of skeletons via attack and augmentation respectively, for generating high-quality hard positive features.

This leads to more discriminative and robust representations. Secondly, the Positive-Negative Mixer (PNM) contributes to the construction of hard negative features. By mixing hard positive features and negative features from an updating memory bank, PNM generates features that are closer to the semantic outer boundary of the anchor.

        "summary": "This paper addresses the problem of robust cross-modal knowledge distillation for unconstrained videos. The authors point out that the irrelevant modality noise and differentiated semantic correlation between modalities can affect the quality of cross-modal distillation performance. To alleviate this issue, they propose a robust cross-modal distillation approach, with the modality noise filter module to explicitly filter irrelevant noise in teacher modality, and the contrastive semantic calibration module to distill useful knowledge for target task, leveraging the differentiated sample-wise semantic correlation. Extensive experiments show that their method could outperform other distillation methods on action recognition, video retrieval, as well as audio tagging tasks.",
        "abstract": "Cross-modal distillation has been widely used to transfer knowledge across different modalities, enriching the representation of the target unimodal one. Recent studies highly relate the temporal synchronization between vision and sound to the semantic consistency for cross-modal distillation. However, such semantic consistency from the synchronization is hard to guarantee in unconstrained videos, due to the irrelevant modality noise and differentiated semantic correlation. To this end, we first propose a \\textit{Modality Noise Filter} (MNF) module to erase the irrelevant noise in teacher modality with cross-modal context. After this purification, we then design a \\textit{Contrastive Semantic Calibration} (CSC) module to adaptively distill useful knowledge for target modality, by referring to the differentiated sample-wise semantic correlation in a contrastive fashion. Extensive experiments show that our method could bring a performance boost compared with other distillation methods in both visual action recognition and video retrieval task. We also extend to the audio tagging task to prove the generalization of our method.

        "summary": "This paper proposes a novel self-supervised representation learning method for skeleton-based action recognition. We treat a skeleton sequence as a 3D skeleton cloud and design a skeleton cloud colorization scheme that colorizes each point in the cloud according to its temporal and spatial orders in the original skeleton sequence. The colorized skeleton point cloud is then used to train an auto-encoder framework that can learn spatial-temporal features from the artificial color labels of skeleton joints effectively.",
        "abstract": "3D Skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Most of the existing work focuses on supervised learning which requires a large number of labeled action sequences that are often expensive and time-consuming to annotate. In this paper, we address self-supervised 3D action representation learning for skeleton-based action recognition. We investigate self-supervised representation learning and design a novel skeleton cloud colorization technique that is capable of learning spatial and temporal skeleton representations from unlabeled skeleton sequence data. We represent a skeleton action sequence as a 3D skeleton cloud and colorize each point in the cloud according to its temporal and spatial orders in the original (unannotated) skeleton sequence. Leveraging the colorized skeleton point cloud, we design an auto-encoder framework that can learn spatial-temporal features from the artificial color labels of skeleton joints effectively. Specifically, we design a two-steam pretraining network that leverages fine-grained and coarse-grained colorization to learn multi-scale spatial-temporal features. In addition, we design a Masked Skeleton Cloud Repainting task that can pretrain the designed auto-encoder framework to learn informative representations. We evaluate our skeleton cloud colorization approach with linear classifiers trained under different configurations, including unsupervised, semi-supervised, fully-supervised, and transfer learning settings. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, PKU-MMD, NW-UCLA, and UWA3D datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing unsupervised and semi-supervised 3D action recognition methods by large margins and achieves competitive performance in supervised 3D action recognition as well.",

        "0_additional_breath_q:answers:expert": "The skeleton cloud representation benefits the self-supervised learning of skeleton sequences for action recognition in several ways.\n\nFirst, the skeleton cloud representation is a more compact and efficient representation of a skeleton sequence than a sequence of individual frames. This is because the skeleton cloud representation only stores the 3D coordinates of the joints in the sequence, while a sequence of individual frames stores the 3D coordinates of all the pixels in each frame. This makes the skeleton cloud representation much more efficient to store and process, which is important for self-supervised learning, as large amounts of data are often required to train self-supervised models.\n\nSecond, the skeleton cloud representation is a more discriminative representation of a skeleton sequence than a sequence of individual frames. This is because the skeleton cloud representation preserves the spatial and temporal relationships between the joints in the sequence, which is crucial for action recognition. A sequence of individual frames, on the other hand, does not preserve these relationships, as the frames are often captured at different times and from different viewpoints. This makes the skeleton cloud representation a more discriminative representation for action recognition, as it is able to capture the key features of an action, even if the action is performed in a different way or from a different viewpoint.\n\nThird, the skeleton cloud representation is less susceptible to noise and outliers than a sequence of individual frames. This is because the skeleton cloud representation is a smoothed representation of the skeleton sequence, which removes noise and outliers. A sequence of individual frames, on the other hand, is not smoothed, and is therefore more susceptible to noise and outliers. This makes the skeleton cloud representation a more robust representation for action recognition, as it is less likely to be affected by noise and outliers in the data.",
        "1_question": "What is the purpose of the skeleton cloud colorization scheme?",
        "1_answers:eli5": "The skeleton cloud colorization scheme is used to assign each point in the skeleton cloud a color that represents its temporal and spatial order in the original skeleton sequence.

        "1_answers:expert": "The skeleton cloud colorization scheme is used to provide the auto-encoder framework with a set of artificial color labels that can be used to learn spatial and temporal relationships between the joints in the skeleton sequence.

This helps the computer understand how the skeleton moves and looks like.",
        "1_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The Masked Skeleton Cloud Repainting task is a pretraining task that we designed to improve the self-supervised representation learning of the skeleton cloud colorization method. The task involves randomly masking (hiding) a certain percentage of points in the colorized skeleton cloud and then training an auto-encoder to reconstruct (guess) the masked points based on the visible points.

        "title": "GoferBot: A Visual Guided Human-Robot Collaborative Assembly System",
        "summary": "This paper presents a novel human-robot collaborative assembly system called GoferBot. This system is vision-based and designed for real-world assembly tasks. It consists of three sub-modules: action recognition, visual servoing, and visual handover. The action recognition module predicts human actions using a deep learning network. The visual servoing module controls the robot's movement to reach and grasp assembly parts. The visual handover module detects human grasp actions and releases the parts accordingly. GoferBot was evaluated in a real-world assembly task, and the results showed that it could successfully complete the task with high accuracy and efficiency. The system also received positive feedback from human participants, who found it to be intuitive and easy to use.",
        "abstract": "The current transformation towards smart manufacturing has led to a growing demand for human-robot collaboration (HRC) in the manufacturing process. Perceiving and understanding the human co-worker's behaviour introduces challenges for collaborative robots to efficiently and effectively perform tasks in unstructured and dynamic environments. Integrating recent data-driven machine vision capabilities into HRC systems is a logical next step in addressing these challenges. However, in these cases, off-the-shelf components struggle due to generalisation limitations. Real-world evaluation is required in order to fully appreciate the maturity and robustness of these approaches. Furthermore, understanding the pure-vision aspects is a crucial first step before combining multiple modalities in order to understand the limitations. In this paper, we propose GoferBot, a novel vision-based semantic HRC system for a real-world assembly task. It is composed of a visual servoing module that reaches and grasps assembly parts in an unstructured multi-instance and dynamic environment, an action recognition module that performs human action prediction for implicit communication, and a visual handover module that uses the perceptual understanding of human behaviour to produce an intuitive and efficient collaborative assembly experience. GoferBot is a novel assembly system that seamlessly integrates all sub-modules by utilising implicit semantic information purely from visual perception.",

This information helps the robot move around and reach for things, like when it's trying to pick up a part to give to the human.",
        "2_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The visual servoing module uses a lightweight fully-convolutional network to generate control action candidates over a grid of image cells based on an RGB image, corresponding joint angles, and a coordinate tensor. The coordinate tensor carries the normalised image UV coordinates of each grid cell, analogous to the approach proposed in \u201cCoordConv\u201d [39]. The network architecture is modified based on [45], [46]. This network regresses the value of a control Lyapunov function along with the associated control inputs over a grid of rectangular super-pixels. Since executing the defined control associated with a given super-pixel decreases the associated Lyapunov value, then choosing the minimal regressed Lyapunov value across the segmentation map performs non-optimal suppression on the control candidates and ensures reliable grasping.",

It analyzes a sequence of video frames captured from a camera observing the human and classifies the human's actions into predefined categories, such as reaching, grasping, or spinning a leg. This information is then used by the system to coordinate its own actions and adapt to the human's behavior.",

        "3_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "The handover module failed because the system did not detect the human's grasp action. The visual servoing module failed because the system could not reach and grasp the assembly part. The action recognition module failed because the system could not predict the human's action.",
        "3_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "**Handover Module Failure:** The handover module failed to detect the human's grasp action due to the inherent noise in the action prediction. To mitigate this, the handover module waits for two consecutive grasp predictions before triggering the grasping module to release the item. **Visual Servoing Module Failure:** The visual servoing module failed to reach and grasp the assembly part due to several factors, including occlusion, lighting conditions, and the presence of distractors. To address this, the visual servoing module employs a Lyapunov function-based approach that ensures reliable grasping even in challenging conditions. **Action Recognition Module Failure:** The action recognition module failed to predict the human's action due to the limitations of the underlying neural network and the complexity of the human-robot interaction. To improve the accuracy of the action recognition module, a more sophisticated neural network architecture could be employed, and additional training data could be collected to cover a wider range of human behaviors.",

The I3D network is trained on a large dataset of human actions, allowing it to recognize a wide range of movements. When the module receives a video stream, it processes the frames to extract spatio-temporal features. These features are then fed into the network, which classifies the action being performed by the human. The output of the action recognition module is a prediction of the most likely action, along with a confidence score.",

        "4_additional_breath_q:answers:eli5": "GoferBot is a pretty good system, but it could be even better if it could learn from its mistakes and adapt to different situations. For example, if GoferBot accidentally drops a part, it could learn to be more careful next time. Or, if GoferBot is working with a new human partner, it could learn to adjust its behavior to match the human's preferences.",

This is particularly beneficial in scenarios with non-stationary data distributions or when new classes are introduced sequentially. Furthermore, experience replay promotes knowledge distillation, allowing the model to leverage past knowledge to enhance its performance on current tasks. However, a major drawback of experience replay is its memory overhead. Maintaining a large buffer of samples can significantly increase the computational cost and memory requirements, especially when dealing with high-dimensional video data. Additionally, managing the buffer, including sample selection strategies and balancing the importance of past tasks, can be challenging and requires careful consideration.",

There are many challenges that researchers are working on, such as how to make models that can recognize activities in more complex environments, how to make models that can recognize activities from multiple people, and how to make models that can recognize activities in real-time.\n\nOne of the main challenges in human activity recognition is that activities can be very complex. For example, a person might be walking and talking at the same time, or they might be cooking and washing dishes. This can make it difficult for models to recognize activities, as they need to be able to understand the different parts of the activity and how they are related to each other.\n\nAnother challenge in human activity recognition is that activities can be performed by multiple people. For example, two people might be playing basketball together, or a group of people might be dancing. This can make it difficult for models to recognize activities, as they need to be able to track the different people and understand how they are interacting with each other.\n\nFinally, human activity recognition can be difficult in real-time. This is because activities can happen very quickly, and models need to be able to recognize them as they are happening. This can be challenging, as models need to be able to process data quickly and make decisions quickly.\n\nDespite these challenges, human activity recognition is a very important field of research.

We strive to reprogram a pre-trained GNN, without amending raw node features nor model parameters, to handle a bunch of cross-level downstream tasks in various domains. To this end, we propose an innovative Data Reprogramming paradigm alongside a Model Reprogramming paradigm. The former one aims to address the challenge of diversified graph feature dimensions for various tasks on the input side, while the latter alleviates the dilemma of fixed per-task-per-model behavior on the model side. For data reprogramming, we specifically devise an elaborated Meta-FeatPadding method to deal with heterogeneous input dimensions, and also develop a transductive Edge-Slimming as well as an inductive Meta-GraPadding approach for diverse homogenous samples. Meanwhile, for model reprogramming, we propose a novel task-adaptive Reprogrammable-Aggregator, to endow the frozen model with larger expressive capacities in handling cross-domain tasks.

Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in various evaluation protocols, outperforming the baseline and other SOTA methods.",
        "abstract": "In recent years, remarkable results have been achieved in self-supervised action recognition using skeleton sequences with contrastive learning. It has been observed that the semantic distinction of human action features is often represented by local body parts, such as legs or hands, which are advantageous for skeleton-based action recognition. This paper proposes an attention-based contrastive learning framework for skeleton representation learning, called SkeAttnCLR, which integrates local similarity and global features for skeleton-based action representations. To achieve this, a multi-head attention mask module is employed to learn the soft attention mask features from the skeletons, suppressing non-salient local features while accentuating local salient features, thereby bringing similar local features closer in the feature space. Additionally, ample contrastive pairs are generated by expanding contrastive pairs based on salient and non-salient features with global features, which guide the network to learn the semantic representations of the entire skeleton. Therefore, with the attention mask mechanism, SkeAttnCLR learns local features under different data augmentation views. The experiment results demonstrate that the inclusion of local feature similarity significantly enhances skeleton-based action representation. Our proposed SkeAttnCLR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NTURGB+D, NTU120-RGB+D, and PKU-MMD datasets.",

        "summary": "Physical adversarial attacks are a type of attack that can be used to fool surveillance systems. These attacks involve creating a physical object that, when placed in the environment, can cause the surveillance system to make a mistake. For example, an attacker could create an adversarial patch that, when placed on a person's clothing, would cause the surveillance system to mistake the person for a different person.",
        "abstract": "Modern automated surveillance techniques are heavily reliant on deep learning methods. Despite the superior performance, these learning systems are inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks - maliciously crafted inputs that are designed to mislead, or trick, models into making incorrect predictions. An adversary can physically change their appearance by wearing adversarial t-shirts, glasses, or hats or by specific behavior, to potentially avoid various forms of detection, tracking and recognition of surveillance systems; and obtain unauthorized access to secure properties and assets. This poses a severe threat to the security and safety of modern surveillance systems. This paper reviews recent attempts and findings in learning and designing physical adversarial attacks for surveillance applications. In particular, we propose a framework to analyze physical adversarial attacks and provide a comprehensive survey of physical adversarial attacks on four key surveillance tasks: detection, identification, tracking, and action recognition under this framework. Furthermore, we review and analyze strategies to defend against the physical adversarial attacks and the methods for evaluating the strengths of the defense. The insights in this paper present an important step in building resilience within surveillance systems to physical adversarial attacks.",

Compared with existing methods only using intra-stream contrast, CSCLR is proposed to introduce more hard samples from other streams, thus resulting in stronger effect of contrastive learning and better generalization performance in downstream tasks.",
        "abstract": "Self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition enjoys a rapid growth along with the development of contrastive learning. The existing methods rely on imposing invariance to augmentations of 3D skeleton within a single data stream, which merely leverages the easy positive pairs and limits the ability to explore the complicated movement patterns. In this paper, we advocate that the defect of single-stream contrast and the lack of necessary feature transformation are responsible for easy positives, and therefore propose a Cross-Stream Contrastive Learning framework for skeleton-based action Representation learning (CSCLR). Specifically, the proposed CSCLR not only utilizes intra-stream contrast pairs, but introduces inter-stream contrast pairs as hard samples to formulate a better representation learning. Besides, to further exploit the potential of positive pairs and increase the robustness of self-supervised representation learning, we propose a Positive Feature Transformation (PFT) strategy which adopts feature-level manipulation to increase the variance of positive pairs. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD. Experimental results show that our proposed CSCLR exceeds the state-of-the-art methods on a diverse range of evaluation protocols.",

It is different from previous methods in two main ways.\n\nFirst, CSCLR uses cross-stream contrastive learning. This means that it learns to recognize actions by comparing the features of skeletons from different data streams, such as the joint stream and the bone stream. Previous methods only used features from a single data stream.\n\nSecond, CSCLR uses positive feature transformation. This means that it manipulates the positive pairs to increase their hardness in feature-level. Previous methods did not use any feature transformation.",

        "0_additional_breath_q:answers:eli5": "CSCLR is like a game where the computer has to learn the best way to describe human actions from videos of people moving. Instead of just looking at one video at a time, CSCLR looks at multiple videos of the same action from different angles and perspectives. It then compares the features it extracts from these different videos to see how similar they are. If the features are very similar, it means that the computer is learning to recognize the action well. But if the features are not very similar, it means that the computer is still confused about some aspects of the action. CSCLR also uses a special technique called Positive Feature Transformation (PFT) to make the computer focus on the most important differences between the videos, which helps it learn more robust features.",

It introduces inter-stream contrast to address the limitations of existing methods that only utilize intra-stream contrast. By contrasting features extracted from different data streams, such as joint, bone, and motion streams, CSCLR is able to generate harder positive samples and enhance the learning of discriminative representations. Furthermore, CSCLR employs Positive Feature Transformation (PFT) to manipulate the positive pairs and increase their variance, resulting in more effective contrastive learning.

        "summary": "This paper presents a framework for compositional action recognition by modeling spatio-temporal interactions between humans, objects, and context. The framework consists of a spatial-temporal interaction encoder that captures human-object interactions and a context-infusion transformer that refines these interactions with contextual information. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Something-Else dataset and demonstrates competitive performance on standard action recognition datasets.",
        "abstract": "Humans have the natural ability to recognize actions even if the objects involved in the action or the background are changed. Humans can abstract away the action from the appearance of the objects and their context which is referred to as compositionality of actions. Compositional action recognition deals with imparting human-like compositional generalization abilities to action-recognition models. In this regard, extracting the interactions between humans and objects forms the basis of compositional understanding. These interactions are not affected by the appearance biases of the objects or the context. But the context provides additional cues about the interactions between things and stuff. Hence we need to infuse context into the human-object interactions for compositional action recognition. To this end, we first design a spatial-temporal interaction encoder that captures the human-object (things) interactions. The encoder learns the spatio-temporal interaction tokens disentangled from the background context. The interaction tokens are then infused with contextual information from the video tokens to model the interactions between things and stuff. The final context-infused spatio-temporal interaction tokens are used for compositional action recognition. We show the effectiveness of our interaction-centric approach on the compositional Something-Else dataset where we obtain a new state-of-the-art result of 83.8% top-1 accuracy outperforming recent important object-centric methods by a significant margin. Our approach of explicit human-object-stuff interaction modeling is effective even for standard action recognition datasets such as Something-Something-V2 and Epic-Kitchens-100 where we obtain comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "Current few-shot action recognition involves two primary sources of information for classification:(1) intra-video information, determined by frame content within a single video clip, and (2) inter-video information, measured by relationships (e.g., feature similarity) among videos. However, existing methods inadequately exploit these two information sources. In terms of intra-video information, current sampling operations for input videos may omit critical action information, reducing the utilization efficiency of video data. For the inter-video information, the action misalignment among videos makes it challenging to calculate precise relationships. Moreover, how to jointly consider both inter- and intra-video information remains under-explored for few-shot action recognition. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Video Information Maximization (VIM), for few-shot video action recognition. VIM is equipped with an adaptive spatial-temporal video sampler and a spatiotemporal action alignment model to maximize intra- and inter-video information, respectively. The video sampler adaptively selects important frames and amplifies critical spatial regions for each input video based on the task at hand. This preserves and emphasizes informative parts of video clips while eliminating interference at the data level. The alignment model performs temporal and spatial action alignment sequentially at the feature level, leading to more precise measurements of inter-video similarity. Finally, These goals are facilitated by incorporating additional loss terms based on mutual information measurement. Consequently, VIM acts to maximize the distinctiveness of video information from limited video data.

The intra-video MI loss encourages the video sampler to retain more class-related information from each video by measuring the mutual information between the sampled frames and the video-level representation. This ensures that the sampled frames capture the essential aspects of the video. The inter-video MI loss, on the other hand, is computed between the aligned features of video pairs. It enforces the alignment process to provide additional class-specific information beyond what would be obtained without alignment. By optimizing these MI loss terms, VIM can effectively maximize the distinctiveness of video information from a limited amount of data.",

This process ensures that actions in different videos start and end at the same time, addressing the issue of temporal misalignment. \n\nThe spatial coordinator (SC) module, on the other hand, focuses on spatial alignment, ensuring that action-specific regions (e.g., the actor or interacting objects) of paired frames are spatially consistent in their positions. It employs a spatial transformer network (STN) to perform this alignment. The STN learns to generate a transformation matrix that warps the frame of one video to match the spatial layout of the frame from the other video. This process compensates for spatial variations, such as camera motion or object\u306e\u4f4d\u7f6e, and aligns the critical action regions for more accurate comparisons.",

In addition, we demonstrate that our proposed model, when pre-trained on Kinetics-400, generalizes well onto the unseen real world video benchmark datasets UCF101 and HMDB51, achieving state-of-the-art performance in action recognition.",

        "0_additional_breath_q:answers:eli5": " LTN is a new way to train a video recognition model. Most existing video recognition methods use a process called contrastive learning, which tries to make the model ignore unimportant differences between frames, like changes in lighting or camera angle. LTN also uses contrastive learning, but it adds a key difference: it also tries to make the model pay attention to important temporal changes in the video, such as someone entering or leaving a room. As a result, LTN can learn more complex relationships between video frames, which leads to better accuracy on tasks like recognizing human actions.",
        "0_additional_breath_q:answers:expert": "LTN proposes a new approach for self-supervised video representation learning via latent time navigation, by incorporating temporal information into the contrastive learning framework. Existing methods that leverage contrastive learning typically maximize the similarity between positive pairs of views, while minimizing the similarity between negative pairs. However, this approach may lead to the loss of pertinent information related to temporal relationships, making it challenging to recognize actions such as 'enter' and 'leave' that rely on temporal order. In contrast, LTN decouples the latent representation code into a 'time-encoded component', which captures temporal changes, and a 'time-invariant component', which represents invariant information. By parameterizing the time information used for data augmentation and incorporating it into the 'time-encoded component' using an orthogonal basis, LTN ensures that the learned video representations are time-aware and can model subtle motions within an action.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study a novel problem in egocentric action recognition, which we term as \"Multimodal Generalization\" (MMG). MMG aims to study how systems can generalize when data from certain modalities is limited or even completely missing. We thoroughly investigate MMG in the context of standard supervised action recognition and the more challenging few-shot setting for learning new action categories. MMG consists of two novel scenarios, designed to support security, and efficiency considerations in real-world applications: (1) missing modality generalization where some modalities that were present during the train time are missing during the inference time, and (2) cross-modal zero-shot generalization, where the modalities present during the inference time and the training time are disjoint. To enable this investigation, we construct a new dataset MMG-Ego4D containing data points with video, audio, and inertial motion sensor (IMU) modalities. Our dataset is derived from Ego4D dataset, but processed and thoroughly re-annotated by human experts to facilitate research in the MMG problem. We evaluate a diverse array of models on MMG-Ego4D and propose new methods with improved generalization ability. In particular, we introduce a new fusion module with modality dropout training, contrastive-based alignment training, and a novel cross-modal prototypical loss for better few-shot performance. We hope this study will serve as a benchmark and guide future research in multimodal generalization problems. The benchmark and code will be available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/MMG_Ego4D.",

        "abstract": "Action recognition is an important problem that requires identifying actions in video by learning complex interactions across scene actors and objects. However, modern deep-learning based networks often require significant computation, and may capture scene context using various modalities that further increases compute costs. Efficient methods such as those used for AR/VR often only use human-keypoint information but suffer from a loss of scene context that hurts accuracy. In this paper, we describe an action-localization method, KeyNet, that uses only the keypoint data for tracking and action recognition. Specifically, KeyNet introduces the use of object based keypoint information to capture context in the scene. Our method illustrates how to build a structured intermediate representation that allows modeling higher-order interactions in the scene from object and human keypoints without using any RGB information. We find that KeyNet is able to track and classify human actions at just 5 FPS. More importantly, we demonstrate that object keypoints can be modeled to recover any loss in context from using keypoint information over AVA action and Kinetics datasets.",

However, an inherent flaw has come to light in these cutting-edge models: they tend to optimize the adjacency matrix jointly with the model weights. This process, while seemingly efficient, causes a gradual decay of bone connectivity data, culminating in a model indifferent to the very topology it sought to map. As a remedy, we propose a threefold strategy: (1) We forge an innovative pathway that encodes bone connectivity by harnessing the power of graph distances. This approach preserves the vital topological nuances often lost in conventional GCNs. (2) We highlight an oft-overlooked feature - the temporal mean of a skeletal sequence, which, despite its modest guise, carries highly action-specific information. (3) Our investigation revealed strong variations in joint-to-joint relationships across different actions. This finding exposes the limitations of a single adjacency matrix in capturing the variations of relational configurations emblematic of human movement, which we remedy by proposing an efficient refinement to Graph Convolutions (GC) - the BlockGC. This evolution slashes parameters by a substantial margin (above 40%), while elevating performance beyond original GCNs.

        "abstract": "How humans understand and recognize the actions of others is a complex neuroscientific problem that involves a combination of cognitive mechanisms and neural networks. Research has shown that humans have brain areas that recognize actions that process top-down attentional information, such as the temporoparietal association area. Also, humans have brain regions dedicated to understanding the minds of others and analyzing their intentions, such as the medial prefrontal cortex of the temporal lobe. Skeleton-based action recognition creates mappings for the complex connections between the human skeleton movement patterns and behaviors. Although existing studies encoded meaningful node relationships and synthesized action representations for classification with good results, few of them considered incorporating a priori knowledge to aid potential representation learning for better performance. LA-GCN proposes a graph convolution network using large-scale language models (LLM) knowledge assistance. First, the LLM knowledge is mapped into a priori global relationship (GPR) topology and a priori category relationship (CPR) topology between nodes. The GPR guides the generation of new \"bone\" representations, aiming to emphasize essential node information from the data level. The CPR mapping simulates category prior knowledge in human brain regions, encoded by the PC-AC module and used to add additional supervision-forcing the model to learn class-distinguishable features. In addition, to improve information transfer efficiency in topology modeling, we propose multi-hop attention graph convolution. It aggregates each node's k-order neighbor simultaneously to speed up model convergence. LA-GCN reaches state-of-the-art on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets.",

The 2D neural networks of deep learning are built for recognizing pixel-level information such as images with RGB, RGB-D, or optical flow formats, with the current increasingly wide usage of surveillance video and more tasks related to human action recognition. There are increasing tasks requiring temporal information for frames dependency analysis. The researchers have widely studied video-based recognition rather than image-based(pixel-based) only to extract more informative elements from geometry tasks. Our current related research addresses multiple novel proposed research works and compares their advantages and disadvantages between the derived deep learning frameworks rather than machine learning frameworks. The comparison happened between existing frameworks and datasets, which are video format data only. Due to the specific properties of human actions and the increasingly wide usage of deep neural networks, we collected all research works within the last three years between 2020 to 2022. In our article, the performance of deep neural networks surpassed most of the techniques in the feature learning and extraction tasks, especially video action recognition.",

With the limitation in the scale of egocentric data collection, learning robust deep learning-based action recognition models remains difficult. Transferring knowledge learned from the large-scale exocentric data to the egocentric data is challenging due to the difference in videos across views. Our work introduces a novel cross-view learning approach to action recognition (CVAR) that effectively transfers knowledge from the exocentric to the egocentric view.

Therefore, we introduce a new dataset, called Cattle Visual Behaviors (CVB), that consists of 502 video clips, each fifteen seconds long, captured in natural lighting conditions, and annotated with eleven visually perceptible behaviors of grazing cattle. We use the Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) to collect our annotations. To make the procedure more efficient, we perform an initial detection and tracking of cattle in the videos using appropriate pre-trained models. The results are corrected by domain experts along with cattle behavior labeling in CVAT. The pre-hoc detection and tracking step significantly reduces the manual annotation time and effort. Moreover, we convert CVB to the atomic visual action (AVA) format and train and evaluate the popular SlowFast action recognition model on it. The associated preliminary results confirm that we can localize the cattle and recognize their frequently occurring behaviors with confidence. By creating and sharing CVB, our aim is to develop improved models capable of recognizing all important behaviors accurately and to assist other researchers and practitioners in developing and evaluating new ML models for cattle behavior classification using video data.",

In order to predict the movement of an object, Botsort takes into account its previous position and the positions of the nearby objects. It also employs some heuristics to adjust the predicted trajectory in response to abrupt changes in the object\u2019s movement, such as a change in speed or direction. Furthermore, Botsort incorporates camera motion compensation to predict the correct location of the object which may fail due to camera motion in complex scenarios. Botsort can track multiple objects simultaneously, even if they move in close proximity. This makes it particularly useful for tracking social interactions between animals. It also handles occlusions to some extent by predicting the location of the occluded object based on its trajectory.",
