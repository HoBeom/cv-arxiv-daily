        "title": "Learning 3D Human Pose Estimation from Dozens of Datasets using a Geometry-Aware Autoencoder to Bridge Between Skeleton Formats",
        "summary": "We present a novel method for learning 3D human pose estimation from dozens of datasets, even when the datasets provide annotations according to different skeleton formats. Our method uses a geometry-aware autoencoder to bridge between the different skeleton formats, and it can be used to regularize the predictions of a 3D pose estimator or to directly predict the latent keypoints of the autoencoder. We show that our method improves the accuracy of 3D pose estimation on a variety of benchmarks, and we release our code and models for research purposes.",
        "abstract": "Deep learning-based 3D human pose estimation performs best when trained on large amounts of labeled data, making combined learning from many datasets an important research direction. One obstacle to this endeavor are the different skeleton formats provided by different datasets, i.e., they do not label the same set of anatomical landmarks. There is little prior research on how to best supervise one model with such discrepant labels. We show that simply using separate output heads for different skeletons results in inconsistent depth estimates and insufficient information sharing across skeletons. As a remedy, we propose a novel affine-combining autoencoder (ACAE) method to perform dimensionality reduction on the number of landmarks. The discovered latent 3D points capture the redundancy among skeletons, enabling enhanced information sharing when used for consistency regularization. Our approach scales to an extreme multi-dataset regime, where we use 28 3D human pose datasets to supervise one model, which outperforms prior work on a range of benchmarks, including the challenging 3D Poses in the Wild (3DPW) dataset. Our code and models are available for research purposes.",

        "0_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "In this paper, the authors tackle a challenging problem in 3D human pose estimation: training a model with different skeleton formats. They propose an af\ufb01ne-combining autoencoder (ACAE) that addresses this issue. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\nThe ACAE takes in a set of 3D keypoints (like the joints of a human body) and converts them into a smaller set of latent keypoints. These latent keypoints capture the overall structure of a pose, and they can be used to reconstruct the original keypoints. The ACAE is trained on a dataset of pseudo ground truth poses, which are created by running the model on real images and then using the model's predictions as ground truth.\n\nOnce the ACAE is trained, it can be used to regularize the model's predictions. This means that the model is encouraged to predict poses that are consistent with the latent keypoints. This helps to improve the model's accuracy and consistency across different datasets and skeleton formats.\n\nIn addition to using the ACAE for regularization, the authors also show that it can be used to directly predict the latent keypoints. This is more ef\ufb01cient than predicting the full set of 3D keypoints because it requires fewer parameters. The latent keypoints can then be used to reconstruct the full set of keypoints using the decoder of the ACAE.\n\nOverall, the ACAE is a powerful tool for handling skeleton discrepancies in 3D human pose estimation. It allows the model to learn from multiple datasets with different skeleton formats, and it can be used to improve the model's accuracy and consistency.",
        "0_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The authors of this paper propose three main approaches to handle skeleton discrepancies in 3D human pose estimation:\n\n1. **Separate skeleton prediction**: This is the simplest approach, where the model predicts the different skeletons on separate output heads, branching out from a common backbone network. This approach is straightforward to implement, but it does not take into account the relations between the different skeletons, which can lead to inconsistent predictions.\n\n2. **Consistency regularization**: This approach uses an af\ufb01ne-combining autoencoder (ACAE) to learn a latent keypoint space that captures the redundancy among the different skeletons. The model is then encouraged to predict poses that are consistent with the latent keypoints, which helps to improve the model's accuracy and consistency across different datasets and skeleton formats.\n\n3. **Direct latent prediction**: This approach uses the ACAE to directly predict the latent keypoints. This is more ef\ufb01cient than predicting the full set of 3D keypoints because it requires fewer parameters. The latent keypoints can then be used to reconstruct the full set of keypoints using the decoder of the ACAE.\n\nThe authors evaluate these three approaches on a challenging benchmark of 28 datasets with different skeleton formats. They show that the consistency regularization approach achieves the best results, followed by the direct latent prediction approach. The separate skeleton prediction approach performs the worst, demonstrating the importance of taking into account the relations between the different skeletons.",

        "summary": "This paper presents a novel approach for estimating dense human pose using WiFi signals. The proposed method, called WiFi-DensePose, utilizes a deep neural network to map the phase and amplitude of WiFi signals to UV coordinates within 24 human regions. The network is trained on a dataset of synchronized WiFi signals and RGB images, and it is able to estimate the dense pose of multiple subjects, with comparable performance to image-based approaches.",
        "abstract": "Advances in computer vision and machine learning techniques have led to significant development in 2D and 3D human pose estimation from RGB cameras, LiDAR, and radars. However, human pose estimation from images is adversely affected by occlusion and lighting, which are common in many scenarios of interest. Radar and LiDAR technologies, on the other hand, need specialized hardware that is expensive and power-intensive. Furthermore, placing these sensors in non-public areas raises significant privacy concerns. To address these limitations, recent research has explored the use of WiFi antennas (1D sensors) for body segmentation and key-point body detection. This paper further expands on the use of the WiFi signal in combination with deep learning architectures, commonly used in computer vision, to estimate dense human pose correspondence. We developed a deep neural network that maps the phase and amplitude of WiFi signals to UV coordinates within 24 human regions. The results of the study reveal that our model can estimate the dense pose of multiple subjects, with comparable performance to image-based approaches, by utilizing WiFi signals as the only input. This paves the way for low-cost, broadly accessible, and privacy-preserving algorithms for human sensing.",
