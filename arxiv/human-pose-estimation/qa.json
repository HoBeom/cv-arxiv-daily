        "summary": "We present a novel method for learning 3D human pose estimation from dozens of datasets, even when the datasets provide annotations according to different skeleton formats. Our method uses a geometry-aware autoencoder to bridge between the different skeleton formats, and it can be used to regularize the predictions of a 3D pose estimator or to directly predict the latent keypoints of the autoencoder. We show that our method improves the accuracy of 3D pose estimation on a variety of benchmarks, and we release our code and models for research purposes.",
        "abstract": "Deep learning-based 3D human pose estimation performs best when trained on large amounts of labeled data, making combined learning from many datasets an important research direction. One obstacle to this endeavor are the different skeleton formats provided by different datasets, i.e., they do not label the same set of anatomical landmarks. There is little prior research on how to best supervise one model with such discrepant labels. We show that simply using separate output heads for different skeletons results in inconsistent depth estimates and insufficient information sharing across skeletons. As a remedy, we propose a novel affine-combining autoencoder (ACAE) method to perform dimensionality reduction on the number of landmarks. The discovered latent 3D points capture the redundancy among skeletons, enabling enhanced information sharing when used for consistency regularization. Our approach scales to an extreme multi-dataset regime, where we use 28 3D human pose datasets to supervise one model, which outperforms prior work on a range of benchmarks, including the challenging 3D Poses in the Wild (3DPW) dataset. Our code and models are available for research purposes.",

        "0_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "In this paper, the authors tackle a challenging problem in 3D human pose estimation: training a model with different skeleton formats. They propose an af\ufb01ne-combining autoencoder (ACAE) that addresses this issue. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\nThe ACAE takes in a set of 3D keypoints (like the joints of a human body) and converts them into a smaller set of latent keypoints. These latent keypoints capture the overall structure of a pose, and they can be used to reconstruct the original keypoints. The ACAE is trained on a dataset of pseudo ground truth poses, which are created by running the model on real images and then using the model's predictions as ground truth.\n\nOnce the ACAE is trained, it can be used to regularize the model's predictions. This means that the model is encouraged to predict poses that are consistent with the latent keypoints. This helps to improve the model's accuracy and consistency across different datasets and skeleton formats.\n\nIn addition to using the ACAE for regularization, the authors also show that it can be used to directly predict the latent keypoints. This is more ef\ufb01cient than predicting the full set of 3D keypoints because it requires fewer parameters. The latent keypoints can then be used to reconstruct the full set of keypoints using the decoder of the ACAE.\n\nOverall, the ACAE is a powerful tool for handling skeleton discrepancies in 3D human pose estimation. It allows the model to learn from multiple datasets with different skeleton formats, and it can be used to improve the model's accuracy and consistency.",
        "0_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The authors of this paper propose three main approaches to handle skeleton discrepancies in 3D human pose estimation:\n\n1. **Separate skeleton prediction**: This is the simplest approach, where the model predicts the different skeletons on separate output heads, branching out from a common backbone network. This approach is straightforward to implement, but it does not take into account the relations between the different skeletons, which can lead to inconsistent predictions.\n\n2. **Consistency regularization**: This approach uses an af\ufb01ne-combining autoencoder (ACAE) to learn a latent keypoint space that captures the redundancy among the different skeletons. The model is then encouraged to predict poses that are consistent with the latent keypoints, which helps to improve the model's accuracy and consistency across different datasets and skeleton formats.\n\n3. **Direct latent prediction**: This approach uses the ACAE to directly predict the latent keypoints. This is more ef\ufb01cient than predicting the full set of 3D keypoints because it requires fewer parameters. The latent keypoints can then be used to reconstruct the full set of keypoints using the decoder of the ACAE.\n\nThe authors evaluate these three approaches on a challenging benchmark of 28 datasets with different skeleton formats. They show that the consistency regularization approach achieves the best results, followed by the direct latent prediction approach. The separate skeleton prediction approach performs the worst, demonstrating the importance of taking into account the relations between the different skeletons.",

        "summary": "This paper presents a novel approach for estimating dense human pose using WiFi signals. The proposed method, called WiFi-DensePose, utilizes a deep neural network to map the phase and amplitude of WiFi signals to UV coordinates within 24 human regions. The network is trained on a dataset of synchronized WiFi signals and RGB images, and it is able to estimate the dense pose of multiple subjects, with comparable performance to image-based approaches.",
        "abstract": "Advances in computer vision and machine learning techniques have led to significant development in 2D and 3D human pose estimation from RGB cameras, LiDAR, and radars. However, human pose estimation from images is adversely affected by occlusion and lighting, which are common in many scenarios of interest. Radar and LiDAR technologies, on the other hand, need specialized hardware that is expensive and power-intensive. Furthermore, placing these sensors in non-public areas raises significant privacy concerns. To address these limitations, recent research has explored the use of WiFi antennas (1D sensors) for body segmentation and key-point body detection. This paper further expands on the use of the WiFi signal in combination with deep learning architectures, commonly used in computer vision, to estimate dense human pose correspondence. We developed a deep neural network that maps the phase and amplitude of WiFi signals to UV coordinates within 24 human regions. The results of the study reveal that our model can estimate the dense pose of multiple subjects, with comparable performance to image-based approaches, by utilizing WiFi signals as the only input. This paves the way for low-cost, broadly accessible, and privacy-preserving algorithms for human sensing.",

Mask RCNN can largely improve the efficiency by conducting person detection and pose estimation in a single framework, as the features provided by the backbone are able to be shared by the two tasks. However, the performance is not as good as traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we aim to largely advance the human pose estimation results of Mask-RCNN and still keep the efficiency. Specifically, we make improvements on the whole process of pose estimation, which contains feature extraction and keypoint detection. The part of feature extraction is ensured to get enough and valuable information of pose. Then, we introduce a Global Context Module into the keypoints detection branch to enlarge the receptive field, as it is crucial to successful human pose estimation. On the COCO val2017 set, our model using the ResNet-50 backbone achieves an AP of 68.1, which is 2.6 higher than Mask RCNN (AP of 65.5). Compared to the classic two-stage top-down method SimpleBaseline, our model largely narrows the performance gap (68.1 AP vs. 68.9 AP) with a much faster inference speed (77 ms vs. 168 ms), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

It consists of 10,749 bounding box and 56,154 keypoint annotations from 22 art-historical depiction styles, including those that have increasingly turned away from lifelike representations of the body since the 19th century. The data set enables the quantitatively systematized exploration of human pose in visual art by capturing the body holistically and across different stylistic periods. It can be used for training and fine-tuning deep-learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for the task of human pose estimation in art-historical imagery.",
        "abstract": "Throughout the history of art, the pose, as the holistic abstraction of the human body's expression, has proven to be a constant in numerous studies. However, due to the enormous amount of data that so far had to be processed by hand, its crucial role to the formulaic recapitulation of art-historical motifs since antiquity could only be highlighted selectively. This is true even for the now automated estimation of human poses, as domain-specific, sufficiently large data sets required for training computational models are either not publicly available or not indexed at a fine enough granularity. With the Poses of People in Art data set, we introduce the first openly licensed data set for estimating human poses in art and validating human pose estimators. It consists of 2,454 images from 22 art-historical depiction styles, including those that have increasingly turned away from lifelike representations of the body since the 19th century. A total of 10,749 human figures are precisely enclosed by rectangular bounding boxes, with a maximum of four per image labeled by up to 17 keypoints; among these are mainly joints such as elbows and knees. For machine learning purposes, the data set is divided into three subsets, training, validation, and testing, that follow the established JSON-based Microsoft COCO format, respectively. Each image annotation, in addition to mandatory fields, provides metadata from the art-historical online encyclopedia WikiArt. With this paper, we elaborate on the acquisition and constitution of the data set, address various application scenarios, and discuss prospects for a digitally supported art history. We show that the data set enables the investigation of body phenomena in art, whether at the level of individual figures, which can be captured in their subtleties, or entire figure constellations, whose position, distance, or proximity to one another is considered.",

The system utilizes a modified TORE volume representation to preserve both recent and historical event information, mitigating the missing torso problem common in event camera-based pose estimation. Additionally, an early-exit-style mask prediction network reduces computational costs and energy consumption by predicting human body masks for multiple future frames and using confidence scores to determine when mask prediction can be skipped. YeLan outperforms baseline models in challenging conditions, demonstrating robustness against various types of clothing, background motion, viewing angles, occlusion, and lighting fluctuations.",
        "abstract": "As a beloved sport worldwide, dancing is getting integrated into traditional and virtual reality-based gaming platforms nowadays. It opens up new opportunities in the technology-mediated dancing space. These platforms primarily rely on passive and continuous human pose estimation as an input capture mechanism. Existing solutions are mainly based on RGB or RGB-Depth cameras for dance games. The former suffers in low-lighting conditions due to the motion blur and low sensitivity, while the latter is too power-hungry, has a low frame rate, and has limited working distance. With ultra-low latency, energy efficiency, and wide dynamic range characteristics, the event camera is a promising solution to overcome these shortcomings. We propose YeLan, an event camera-based 3-dimensional high-frequency human pose estimation(HPE) system that survives low-lighting conditions and dynamic backgrounds. We collected the world's first event camera dance dataset and developed a fully customizable motion-to-event physics-aware simulator.

        "1_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "Imagine the missing torso problem as a game of hide-and-seek. Some body parts, like the torso, might stay hidden (not moving) while others, like the arms and legs, are moving around. YeLan uses a special representation called TORE to store information about both recent and past events. This helps YeLan 'remember' where the hidden body parts are, even if they're not moving at the moment.",
        "1_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "YeLan addresses the 'missing torso' problem by leveraging a modified Time Ordered Recent Event (TORE) volume representation. TORE preserves both recent and short historical information, enabling the estimation of joint positions even when some body parts remain stationary. This modified TORE volume is created by normalizing, flipping, and range-scaling the original TORE volume. The modified TORE volume is then used as input to the human pose estimation network, which consists of a feature extractor, a BiConvLSTM layer, and three hourglass-like refine blocks. The feature extractor and the backbone network architecture have been developed based on a model proposed in [74]. For each joint, YeLan generates three heatmaps showing the probability of its projected position on xy, xz, and yz planes. Then a soft-argmax operator is applied to extract the normalized coordinates of the joint. Lastly, predictions from the xy plane are used as the final prediction for x and y coordinates, while values for z are calculated by averaging the yz and xz predictions.",
        "1_additional_breath_q:follow up question": "How does YeLan solve the 'missing torso' problem?",
        "1_additional_breath_q:answers:eli5": "The missing torso problem occurs when some body parts remain stationary while others are moving, which leads to event cameras only capturing the moving parts and ignoring the static ones. To solve this, YeLan utilizes a modified Time Ordered Recent Event (TORE) volume representation. TORE preserves both recent and historical event information, ensuring that even when body parts are stationary, the model can still estimate their positions based on the recorded history.",
        "1_additional_breath_q:answers:expert": "The missing torso problem arises due to the dynamic nature of event cameras, where only moving body parts trigger events. YeLan tackles this issue by employing a modified Time Ordered Recent Event (TORE) volume representation. TORE maintains a FIFO queue for each pixel, storing the timestamps of recent events. By using a logarithmic scale, TORE preserves both recent and historical event information. This allows the model to estimate joint positions even when body parts remain stationary, as the TORE volume retains the information from previous movements.",

        "2_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The modified TORE volume provides several advantages over the standard TORE representation in the context of YeLan. The normalization and value flipping ensure that the representation is better suited for neural network training, facilitating faster convergence and improved accuracy. Additionally, the range scaling addresses the issue of older events having higher values in the standard TORE, which could hinder the model's ability to distinguish between recent and distant events.

        "title": "HSTFormer: Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Transformers for 3D Human Pose Estimation",
        "summary": "We introduce HSTFormer, a novel transformer-based framework for 3D human pose estimation that exploits the hierarchical bottom-up structure of a pose. HSTFormer consists of four transformer encoders (TEs) and a fusion module. The TEs are organized to learn different correlations of joints from local to global as follows: (i) the Spatial Correlation (SC) of an individual single frame; (ii) the Joint-level Temporal Correlation (JTC) across frames; (iii) the Body-part-level Temporal Correlation (BTC), which groups joints' correlation across frames; and (iv) the Pose-level Temporal Correlation (PTC) of all joints across frames. By hierarchically bottom-up processing the 2D pose sequences, HSTFormer is able to extract valuable information both locally and globally, resulting in more accurate 3D pose estimation. Extensive experiments on Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and HumanEva datasets demonstrate the superior performance and high generalization ability of HSTFormer. Specifically, it outperforms the existing SOTA approaches by a remarkable margin on the challenging MPI-INF-3DHP dataset, decreasing the MPJPE by 24.6% (from 54.9 mm to 41.4 mm).",
        "abstract": "Transformer-based approaches have been successfully proposed for 3D human pose estimation (HPE) from 2D pose sequence and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, current SOTAs have difficulties in modeling spatial-temporal correlations of joints at different levels simultaneously. This is due to the poses' spatial-temporal complexity. Poses move at various speeds temporarily with various joints and body-parts movement spatially. Hence, a cookie-cutter transformer is non-adaptable and can hardly meet the \"in-the-wild\" requirement. To mitigate this issue, we propose Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal transFormers (HSTFormer) to capture multi-level joints' spatial-temporal correlations from local to global gradually for accurate 3D HPE. HSTFormer consists of four transformer encoders (TEs) and a fusion module. To the best of our knowledge, HSTFormer is the first to study hierarchical TEs with multi-level fusion. Extensive experiments on three datasets (i.e., Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and HumanEva) demonstrate that HSTFormer achieves competitive and consistent performance on benchmarks with various scales and difficulties. Specifically, it surpasses recent SOTAs on the challenging MPI-INF-3DHP dataset and small-scale HumanEva dataset, with a highly generalized systematic approach.

        "1_additional_breath_q:answers:expert": "**Detection and Integral Regression**\n\nDetection methods in human pose estimation aim to locate human keypoints by estimating a likelihood heatmap for each keypoint. The heatmap represents the probability of each pixel being a given keypoint. A common approach is to use an argmax operation on the heatmap to obtain the estimated keypoint coordinates.\n\nIntegral regression methods, on the other hand, use a softmax function together with an expectation operation to decode the heatmap. This approach allows for direct learning of keypoint coordinates without imposing a Gaussian structure on the heatmap.\n\n**Key Differences**\n\n1. **Training:** Integral regression is an end-to-end trainable method, whereas detection methods require separate training of the heatmap estimator and the keypoint decoder.\n\n2. **Accuracy:** Integral regression has been shown to achieve higher accuracy than detection methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with occlusions or complex poses.\n\n3. **Speed:** Detection methods are generally faster than integral regression methods due to their simpler decoding process.\n\n4. **Heatmap Density:** Integral regression tends to produce more localized heatmaps compared to detection methods, which can lead to lower accuracy in some cases.\n\nThese differences have implications for the choice of method in different applications.

This simple compensation scheme is plug-and-play for all integral regression methods and significantly improves accuracy. \n\nFor the backward pass, BCIR explores the update behavior of integral regression by explicitly deriving the gradients. In the initial stage of training, the gradients should give a large response around the ground truth location; however, for integral regression, the gradients tend to respond on pixels having large predicted values or heatmap, which do not usually overlap with the ground truth location. Integral regression takes more epochs than detection to locate the ground truth in the heatmap, hence the slow convergence rate as stated in Finding 2. A dense form of supervision, e.g., the aforementioned spatial prior, can give indications of the ground truth location in the heatmap to speed up training convergence.\n\nIn summary, this paper presents a localized heatmap model that unifies the performance behavior of both integral regression and detection methods. By merging our theoretical and empirical findings, we arrive at a bias-compensated integral regression (BCIR) method. Together with either a regularizer or a spatial prior, BCIR is fast to train and has competitive accuracy on both human and hand pose estimation benchmarks.",

Our attack manifests in two forms, sparse category-wise attack (SCA) and dense category-wise attack (DCA), that minimize the $L_0$ and $L_\\infty$ norm-based perturbations, respectively. For DCA, we present three variants, DCA-G, DCA-L, and DCA-S, that select a global region, a local region, and a semantic region, respectively, to attack. Our experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets including PascalVOC, MS-COCO, and MS-COCO Keypoints indicate that our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art attack performance and transferability on both object detection and human pose estimation tasks.",

DECA jointly addresses multiple tasks, such as 3D and 2D human pose estimation. It is shown how DECA works with limited training data, no data augmentation, and across different input domains (RGB and depth images). The feature space organization, defined by routing the input information to build capsule entities, improves when the tasks are jointly addressed. DECA is evaluated on the ITOP dataset for the depth domain and on the PanopTOP31K dataset for the RGB domain. DECA establishes a new baseline for the viewpoint transfer task and in the RGB domain.",
        "abstract": "The task of human pose estimation (HPE) deals with the ill-posed problem of estimating the 3D position of human joints directly from images and videos. In recent literature, most of the works tackle the problem mostly by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are capable of achieving state-of-the-art results in most datasets. We show how most neural networks are not able to generalize well when the camera is subject to significant viewpoint changes. This behaviour emerges because CNNs lack the capability of modelling viewpoint equivariance, while they rather rely on viewpoint invariance, resulting in high data dependency. Recently, capsule networks (CapsNets) have been proposed in the multi-class classification field as a solution to the viewpoint equivariance issue, reducing both the size and complexity of both the training datasets and the network itself. In this work, we show how capsule networks can be adopted to achieve viewpoint equivariance in human pose estimation. We propose a novel end-to-end viewpoint-equivariant capsule autoencoder that employs a fast Variational Bayes routing and matrix capsules. We achieve state-of-the-art results for multiple tasks and datasets while retaining other desirable properties, such as greater generalization capabilities when changing viewpoints, lower data dependency and fast inference. Additionally, by modelling each joint as a capsule, the hierarchical and geometrical structure of the overall pose is retained in the feature space, independently from the viewpoint. We further test our network on multiple datasets, both in the RGB and depth domain, from seen and unseen viewpoints and in the viewpoint transfer task.",

        "title": "View Consistency Aware Holistic Triangulation for 3D Human Pose Estimation",
        "summary": "Multi-view 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is a significant computer vision problem with numerical applications such as human behavior analysis, X-reality, etc. To estimate 3D pose, there are two sensor setting streams: monocular and multi-view. In this paper, we focus on multi-view 3D HPE, for its capability to estimate absolute 3D position without inherent depth ambiguities which monocular suffers. One of the most common frameworks of multi-view methods follows a two-step procedure: (1) detect 2D keypoints of human skeleton at each view separately, (2) apply Linear Triangulation (LT) which utilizes epipolar geometry to reconstruct 3D pose. The framework is elegant because 2D detectors can be off-the-shelf and closed-form solution LT enables end-to-end training but without any learning cost. However, there are still two main drawbacks: (1) 2D keypoints detected in each view are independent of each other, and will be hampered by the occlusion and overlap due to lack of view consistency. (2) LT in step 2 calculates each 3D joint individually, neglecting the global context of whole pose. Hence, it is unable to identify the 3D outliers, which usually causes implausible poses. To solve the first problem, Multi-View Fusion (MVF) module is proposed to refine the 2D keypoint by establishing view correlations. We argue that multiple image points projected from a 3D point share similar representations. In another word, two most similar points in different views are mostly intersected to one 3D point. According to this assumption, MVF utilizes keypoints detected in source views to generate pseudo heatmaps which represents the probability distribution the keypoint localized in reference view through feature matching. And pseudo heatmaps can guide the reference keypoints to perceive other views. There are also some works aimed to enhance view consistency through feature fusion: the fully-connected CrossView and the epipolar sample fusion in Epipolar Transformer. But, in MVF, the utilization of the detected keypoint location makes calculation more efficient, and the pseudo heatmap guidance is also more intuitive than feature fusion. Then to boost the plausibility of 3D poses, Holistic Triangulation (HT) with anatomy constraints is proposed, which enables all 3D keypoints to gain access to pose coherence through 2D-3D phase. Firstly, we modify the formulation of objective function so that all joints can be inferred as an entirety. Then, to model the joints linear dependence in the objective function, a PCA reconstruction term is injected. By doing so, joints are coupled in an abstract PCA subspace spanned by the principle components, which contains the global context of whole pose. Human anatomy prior therefore is implicitly introduced. Furthermore, to make the prior more explicit, PCA feature is extended from keypoint position to skeletal structure feature by applying kinematic chain space (KCS). Benefiting from the linear property of PCA, HT is still closed-optimized and differentiable. Consequently, we integrate the 2D detector, MVF and HT into one end-to-end framework and introduce reprojected loss, bone length loss and joint angle loss to promote the view consistency and anatomy coherence during training procedure. In addition, a plausible-pose evaluation metric is proposed to fill in the gap of pose plausibility criterion. Without bells and whistles, MVF-HT method exhibits competitive performance with state-of-the-art techniques, surpassing them in both precision, plausibility and generalization. Moreover, the anatomy prior extracted by PCA is explored through visualization. The main contributions are summarized below: \u2022 We propose a novel MVF module to enhance the view consistency in 2D keypoint estimation. MVF refines 2D keypoint p through perceiving the possible position the same keypoints in other views may localize in the view of p. \u2022 To our best knowledge, this is the first work to reconstruct the whole 3D pose at once under the triangulation framework. Besides, we inject the anatomy prior extracted by PCA to restrict the pose coherence. In this way, the plausibility of pose is improved. \u2022 Our framework can be trained end-to-end but without any learning cost in 2D-3D phase because of the closed-form solution of HT. And a plausible-pose evaluation metric is proposed to fill in the gap of pose plausibility criterion.",
        "abstract": "The rapid development of multi-view 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is attributed to the maturation of monocular 2D HPE and the geometry of 3D reconstruction. However, 2D detection outliers in occluded views due to neglect of view consistency, and 3D implausible poses due to lack of pose coherence, remain challenges. To solve this, we introduce a Multi-View Fusion module to refine 2D results by establishing view correlations. Then, Holistic Triangulation is proposed to infer the whole pose as an entirety, and anatomy prior is injected to maintain the pose coherence and improve the plausibility. Anatomy prior is extracted by PCA whose input is skeletal structure features, which can factor out global context and joint-by-joint relationship from abstract to concrete. Benefiting from the closed-form solution, the whole framework is trained end-to-end. Our method outperforms the state of the art in both precision and plausibility which is assessed by a new metric.",

Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed modules and HopFIR architecture by providing new state-of-the-art results on two challenging datasets, i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.",
        "abstract": "2D-to-3D human pose lifting is fundamental for 3D human pose estimation (HPE), for which graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have proven inherently suitable for modeling the human skeletal topology. However, the current GCN-based 3D HPE methods update the node features by aggregating their neighbors' information without considering the interaction of joints in different joint synergies. Although some studies have proposed importing limb information to learn the movement patterns, the latent synergies among joints, such as maintaining balance are seldom investigated. We propose the Hop-wise GraphFormer with Intragroup Joint Refinement (HopFIR) architecture to tackle the 3D HPE problem. HopFIR mainly consists of a novel hop-wise GraphFormer (HGF) module and an intragroup joint refinement (IJR) module. The HGF module groups the joints by k-hop neighbors and applies a hopwise transformer-like attention mechanism to these groups to discover latent joint synergies. The IJR module leverages the prior limb information for peripheral joint refinement.

        "summary": "Existing human-centric computer vision tasks mostly focus on human in natural scenes, ignoring the presence of humans in a variety of other forms, such as sculptures and paintings. To address this gap, we present Human-Art, a versatile human-centric dataset, which contains 50k high-quality images with over 123k person instances from both natural and artificial scenarios. It is hierarchically structured and includes 20 high-quality scenes. We demonstrate the value of Human-Art with comprehensive experiments on human detection, human pose estimation, image generation, and motion transfer. The experiments show that existing human-centric CV tasks still have a long way to go before reaching maturity when facing Human-Art.",
        "abstract": "Humans have long been recorded in a variety of forms since antiquity. For example, sculptures and paintings were the primary media for depicting human beings before the invention of cameras. However, most current human-centric computer vision tasks like human pose estimation and human image generation focus exclusively on natural images in the real world. Artificial humans, such as those in sculptures, paintings, and cartoons, are commonly neglected, making existing models fail in these scenarios. As an abstraction of life, art incorporates humans in both natural and artificial scenes. We take advantage of it and introduce the Human-Art dataset to bridge related tasks in natural and artificial scenarios. Specifically, Human-Art contains 50k high-quality images with over 123k person instances from 5 natural and 15 artificial scenarios, which are annotated with bounding boxes, keypoints, self-contact points, and text information for humans represented in both 2D and 3D. It is, therefore, comprehensive and versatile for various downstream tasks. We also provide a rich set of baseline results and detailed analyses for related tasks, including human detection, 2D and 3D human pose estimation, image generation, and motion transfer. As a challenging dataset, we hope Human-Art can provide insights for relevant research and open up new research questions.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scheme for proactive Multi-Camera Collaboration in 3D Human Pose Estimation in dynamic human crowds. Traditional fixed-viewpoint multi-camera solutions for human motion capture (MoCap) are limited in capture space and susceptible to dynamic occlusions. Active camera approaches proactively control camera poses to find optimal viewpoints for 3D reconstruction. However, current methods still face challenges with credit assignment and environment dynamics. To address these issues, our proposed method introduces a novel Collaborative Triangulation Contribution Reward (CTCR) that improves convergence and alleviates multi-agent credit assignment issues resulting from using 3D reconstruction accuracy as the shared reward. Additionally, we jointly train our model with multiple world dynamics learning tasks to better capture environment dynamics and encourage anticipatory behaviors for occlusion avoidance. We evaluate our proposed method in four photo-realistic UE4 environments to ensure validity and generalizability. Empirical results show that our method outperforms fixed and active baselines in various scenarios with different numbers of cameras and humans.",

The previous method ignored two problems: (i) When conducting interactive training between large model and lightweight model, the pseudo label of lightweight model will be used to guide large models.

We introduce an additional auxiliary teacher and use the pseudo labels generated by the two teacher model in different periods to calculate the inconsistency score and remove outliers. Then, the two teacher models are updated through interactive training, and the student model is updated using the pseudo labels generated by two teachers. To further improve the performance of the student model, we use the semi-supervised Cut-Occlude based on pseudo keypoint perception to generate more hard and effective samples.

        "3_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "Different backbone networks for student and teacher models affects the performance of the proposed method. Using a smaller backbone network for the student model and a larger backbone network for the teacher model generally leads to better performance.",
        "3_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "Using a smaller backbone network for the student model and a larger backbone network for the teacher model generally leads to better performance. This is because the larger backbone network can extract more discriminative features, which can help the student model learn more accurate predictions. However, if the backbone network of the student model is too small, it may not be able to capture all of the relevant information from the input image, which can lead to decreased performance.",

        "3_additional_breath_q:answers:expert": "Yes, there is an advantage to using the PCM module even when the student model and teacher model have the same network structure. The PCM module helps to correct pseudo labels by removing outliers. This can improve the accuracy of the student model, especially when the teacher model is not perfect.\n\nThe PCM module works by calculating the position inconsistency between the pseudo labels generated by the two teacher models. Position inconsistency is a measure of how much the pseudo labels differ in terms of their predicted keypoint locations. The PCM module then selects a group of pseudo labels with the smallest position inconsistency and uses these labels to generate the final corrected pseudo labels.\n\nUsing the PCM module to correct pseudo labels can improve the accuracy of the student model because it helps to remove noise from the pseudo labels. Noise in the pseudo labels can come from a variety of sources, such as errors in the teacher model or ambiguities in the input data. By removing noise from the pseudo labels, the PCM module can help the student model to learn more accurate representations of the data.",

        "1_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "Sure, here is an ELI5 version of the answer for the effect of the different numbers of temporal crops and self-supervised pre-training on the performance of T-ViTPose:\n\n**Temporal Crops**: Imagine you have a video of someone moving. You can break down the video into a series of still images, called frames. Each frame is like a snapshot of the person's pose at a particular moment in time. If you have more frames, you have more information about the person's pose over time. This can help the T-ViTPose model to make more accurate predictions.\n\n**Self-Supervised Pre-Training**: Imagine you have a child who is learning to read. You can give the child a book and have them try to read it. However, the child may not be able to read all of the words. To help the child learn, you can give them a book with words that they already know. This will help the child to learn to read new words more easily. In the same way, self-supervised pre-training helps the T-ViTPose model to learn to recognize poses more easily.\n\n**Results**: Our experiments showed that using more temporal crops and self-supervised pre-training improved the performance of the T-ViTPose model. This is because more temporal crops provide the model with more information about the person's pose over time, and self-supervised pre-training helps the model to learn to recognize poses more easily.",
        "1_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "**Effect of Temporal Crops**: Increasing the number of temporal crops improves the performance of T-ViTPose because it provides the model with more information about the person's pose over time. This is especially important for challenging tasks, such as estimating 3D pose from pressure data, where the data is often noisy and ambiguous. More temporal crops allow the model to capture more subtle changes in the pressure data, which can lead to more accurate pose estimates.\n\n**Effect of Self-Supervised Pre-training**: Self-supervised pre-training helps the T-ViTPose model to learn to recognize poses more easily. This is because the model is trained on a large dataset of unlabeled data, which forces it to learn general features of human pose. This knowledge can then be transferred to the task of pose estimation from pressure data, which is a more challenging task.\n\n**Overall, our experiments showed that using more temporal crops and self-supervised pre-training improved the performance of the T-ViTPose model.

        "abstract": "In recent years, computer vision tasks like target tracking and human pose estimation have immensely benefited from synthetic data generation and novel rendering techniques. On the other hand, methods in robotics, especially for robot perception, have been slow to leverage these techniques. This is because state-of-the-art simulation frameworks for robotics lack either complete control, integration with the Robot Operating System (ROS), realistic physics or photorealism. To solve this, we present a fully customizable framework for generating realistic animated dynamic environments (GRADE) for robotics research, focused primarily at robot perception. The framework can be used either to generate ground truth data for robotic vision-related tasks and offline processing, or to experiment with robots online in dynamic environments. We build upon the Nvidia Isaac Sim to allow control of custom robots. We provide methods to include assets, populate and control the simulation, and process the data. Using autonomous robots in GRADE, we generate video datasets of an indoor dynamic environment. First, we use it to demonstrate the framework's visual realism by evaluating the sim-to-real gap through experiments with YOLO and Mask R-CNN. Second, we benchmark dynamic SLAM algorithms with this dataset.

It's like a virtual playground where robots can play and learn without getting hurt. But even though GRADE is great, it's not perfect. One limitation is that it's not always super realistic. Sometimes, the things that happen in GRADE don't look exactly like they would in the real world. This can make it hard for robots to learn how to handle certain situations. Another limitation is that GRADE can't simulate everything. It's focused on helping robots learn about indoor environments, so it's not very good at simulating outdoor environments like forests or beaches. Finally, GRADE can be a bit slow.

The detective knows that a human body has a specific shape and structure, so instead of looking at each body part individually, the detective looks at the whole body as a whole. This helps the detective to figure out the pose of each body part more accurately and quickly, even if some parts of the body are hidden or unclear.",
        "4_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The top-down method for human pose estimation starts by detecting the whole human body in the image, and then it estimates the pose of each body part relative to the whole body. This approach is more robust to occlusion and deformation of body parts than bottom-up methods, which estimate the pose of each body part individually and then group them to form a complete pose. This is because the top-down method can use the context of the whole body to help estimate the pose of each body part, even if some parts are not clearly visible. Additionally, the top-down method can incorporate high-level information about the human body, such as prior knowledge about human anatomy and shape, which can further improve the accuracy and robustness of the pose estimation.",

        "6_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "By finding the closest keypoints in the COCO dataset for each keypoint in the JRDB-Pose dataset, the proposed framework can copy the last convolution weights from COCO, leading to a more accurate initialization for the pose estimation model.

This initialization strategy effectively addresses the keypoint mismatch between the COCO and JRDB-Pose datasets, leading to improved pose estimation accuracy.",
        "7_additional_depth_q:follow up question": "In the context of pose estimation, can you provide further explanation on the necessity of accurately transferring keypoint knowledge?",
        "7_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "When estimating a person's pose, we need to know the location of their body parts, like their head, shoulders, elbows, and knees. Just like we need to know the location of a puzzle piece to fit it in the right place, we need to know the location of body parts to estimate a pose accurately. \n\nThe HRNet pose estimation network is trained on the COCO dataset, which has different keypoint locations than the JRDB-Pose dataset. So, the network needs to adjust its understanding of where the body parts are located in order to make accurate pose estimations on the JRDB-Pose dataset. \n\nThe nearest-match-based weight initialization helps the HRNet network transfer its knowledge from the COCO dataset to the JRDB-Pose dataset more accurately. It helps the network learn the corresponding keypoint locations between the two datasets and makes its pose estimations more precise.",
        "7_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "In the context of pose estimation, accurately transferring keypoint knowledge is crucial for aligning the understanding of body part locations between different datasets. This is because pose estimation models are trained on specific datasets with defined keypoint annotations, and applying them to datasets with different keypoint definitions can lead to misalignment and inaccurate pose estimations. \n\nThe nearest-match-based weight initialization method plays a significant role in addressing this challenge by establishing a correspondence between the keypoints in the source (COCO) and target (JRDB-Pose) datasets. Each keypoint in the target dataset is mapped to its nearest counterpart in the source dataset, and the corresponding weights in the last convolution layer of the pose estimation network are transferred. This transfer of knowledge helps the network adapt to the target dataset's keypoint definitions and improves the accuracy of its pose estimations.",

        "7_additional_breath_q:answers:eli5": "The keypoint locations in the COCO dataset are different from the JRDB-Pose dataset. To deal with this mismatch, the proposed method initialized the weights of the last convolution layer (that maps features to keypoints) by finding the nearest counterpart(s) for each keypoint in the JRDB-Pose dataset within the COCO dataset and copying the weights for that counterpart.",
        "7_additional_breath_q:answers:expert": "To address the keypoint mismatch between the COCO and JRDB-Pose datasets, the proposed framework adopts a novel nearest-match-based weight initialization for the HRNet pose estimation network. For each keypoint in the JRDB-Pose dataset, the initiative finds the nearest counterpart(s) in the COCO dataset. It then copies the last convolution weights for this counterpart (or the average weights if multiple counterparts exist) into the corresponding weights of the HRNet network. This initialization effectively aligns the keypoint locations and enhances the accuracy of pose estimation.",

        "8_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "The proposed framework uses a method called top-down approach to overcome the challenges of different sizes of individuals in panoramic images. The framework first detects the entire body and then estimates the pose of each body part. This approach allows the framework to be more robust to multi-scale targets, including individuals of different sizes.",
        "8_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The proposed framework addresses the variation in the sizes of individuals in panoramic images by employing a top-down pose estimation approach. Unlike bottom-up methods that estimate individual body parts first and then group them into a complete pose, the top-down approach detects the entire body and then estimates the pose of each body part. This approach leverages high-level information about the human body, including prior knowledge about human anatomy and shape. Consequently, the framework becomes more robust to multi-scale targets, enabling it to accurately estimate poses for individuals of varying sizes.",

        "8_additional_breath_q:answers:expert": "The key difference between our proposed framework and the baseline methods is the way we initialize the weights of the HRNet model. In the baseline methods, the weights of the HRNet model are initialized from a model that was trained on the COCO dataset. However, the keypoint annotations in the COCO dataset are different from the ones in the JRDB-Pose dataset. This can lead to errors when estimating human poses. In our framework, we initialize the weights of the HRNet model using a nearest-match-based approach. This approach finds the nearest counterpart(s) for each keypoint in the JRDB-Pose dataset in the COCO dataset. It then copies the weights of the last convolution for the corresponding counterpart(s) to the HRNet model. This helps to initialize the weights of the HRNet model more accurately for the task of human pose estimation on the JRDB-Pose dataset.\n\nAnother difference between our framework and the baseline methods is the human detector we use. The baseline methods use a simple human detector that is not very accurate. This can lead to errors when estimating human poses, as the detector may not find all of the people in the image or may find people who are not actually in the image. In our framework, we use a more advanced human detector that is more accurate. This helps to improve the accuracy of our human pose estimation results.",

It's tough because there are lots of people, and they're all moving in different directions. Researchers are working on improving the way computers can understand these movements, but there are still some challenges.\n\nOne challenge is that people can be hidden behind other people or objects, so computers can't always see them. Another challenge is that people move in different ways, so computers need to be able to recognize different movements. Researchers are working on new techniques to overcome these challenges and make computers better at understanding human movement.",

        "summary": "This paper presents a novel framework, named Temporal Difference Learning based on Mutual Information (TDMI) for human pose estimation in videos. TDMI consists of two key components: a multi-stage Temporal Difference Encoder (TDE) designed to model motion contexts conditioned on multi-stage feature differences among video frames, and a Representation Disentanglement module (RDM) that distills task-relevant motion features via an information-theoretic objective. TDMI achieves new state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets, PoseTrack2017, PoseTrack2018, PoseTrack21, and HiEve.",
        "abstract": "Temporal modeling is crucial for multi-frame human pose estimation. Most existing methods directly employ optical flow or deformable convolution to predict full-spectrum motion fields, which might incur numerous irrelevant cues, such as a nearby person or background. Without further efforts to excavate meaningful motion priors, their results are suboptimal, especially in complicated spatiotemporal interactions. On the other hand, the temporal difference has the ability to encode representative motion information which can potentially be valuable for pose estimation but has not been fully exploited. In this paper, we present a novel multi-frame human pose estimation framework, which employs temporal differences across frames to model dynamic contexts and engages mutual information objectively to facilitate useful motion information disentanglement. To be specific, we design a multi-stage Temporal Difference Encoder that performs incremental cascaded learning conditioned on multi-stage feature difference sequences to derive informative motion representation. We further propose a Representation Disentanglement module from the mutual information perspective, which can grasp discriminative task-relevant motion signals by explicitly defining useful and noisy constituents of the raw motion features and minimizing their mutual information. These place us to rank No.1 in the Crowd Pose Estimation in Complex Events Challenge on benchmark dataset HiEve, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks PoseTrack2017, PoseTrack2018, and PoseTrack21.",

This is important for applications such as surveillance and security, where it is often necessary to identify people in challenging conditions. Finally, it would be useful to develop models that can estimate poses from multiple cameras. This would allow for more accurate and complete pose estimation, as well as the ability to track people as they move through a scene."

        "abstract": "Event camera, as an emerging biologically-inspired vision sensor for capturing motion dynamics, presents new potential for 3D human pose tracking, or video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, existing works in pose tracking either require the presence of additional gray-scale images to establish a solid starting pose, or ignore the temporal dependencies all together by collapsing segments of event streams to form static event frames. Meanwhile, although the effectiveness of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs, a.k.a. dense deep learning) has been showcased in many event-based tasks, the use of ANNs tends to neglect the fact that compared to the dense frame-based image sequences, the occurrence of events from an event camera is spatiotemporally much sparser. Motivated by the above mentioned issues, we present in this paper a dedicated end-to-end sparse deep learning approach for event-based pose tracking: 1) to our knowledge this is the first time that 3D human pose tracking is obtained from events only, thus eliminating the need of accessing to any frame-based images as part of input; 2) our approach is based entirely upon the framework of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which consists of Spike-Element-Wise (SEW) ResNet and a novel Spiking Spatiotemporal Transformer; 3) a large-scale synthetic dataset is constructed that features a broad and diverse set of annotated 3D human motions, as well as longer hours of event stream data, named SynEventHPD. Empirical experiments demonstrate that, with superior performance over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ANNs counterparts, our approach also achieves a significant computation reduction of 80% in FLOPS. Furthermore, our proposed method also outperforms SOTA SNNs in the regression task of human pose tracking. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/JimmyZou/HumanPoseTracking_SNN and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.",

It reprojects 3D pose hypotheses to the 2D camera plane, selects the best hypothesis joint-by-joint based on the reprojection errors, and combines the selected joints into the final pose. The proposed JPMA conducts aggregation at the joint level and makes use of the 2D prior information, both of which have been overlooked by previous approaches. Extensive experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic approaches by 1.5% and 8.9%, respectively.

        "summary": "This paper presents a hybrid ANN-SNN architecture that combines the advantages of both artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) to achieve low-power and low-latency visual perception. The proposed architecture uses an auxiliary ANN to initialize the SNN states periodically at low rates, thus eliminating the need for the SNN states to converge and enabling high-rate predictions with low power consumption. Experiments on the tasks of 2D and 3D human pose estimation demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid approach in reducing power consumption while maintaining accuracy.",
        "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are a class of bio-inspired neural networks that promise to bring low-power and low-latency inference to edge devices through asynchronous and sparse processing. However, being temporal models, SNNs depend heavily on expressive states to generate predictions on par with classical artificial neural networks (ANNs). These states converge only after long transient periods, and quickly decay without input data, leading to higher latency, power consumption, and lower accuracy. This work addresses this issue by initializing the state with an auxiliary ANN running at a low rate. The SNN then uses the state to generate predictions with high temporal resolution until the next initialization phase. Our hybrid ANN-SNN model thus combines the best of both worlds: It does not suffer from long state transients and state decay thanks to the ANN, and can generate predictions with high temporal resolution, low latency, and low power thanks to the SNN. We show for the task of event-based 2D and 3D human pose estimation that our method consumes 88% less power with only a 4% decrease in performance compared to its fully ANN counterparts when run at the same inference rate. Moreover, when compared to SNNs, our method achieves a 74% lower error. This research thus provides a new understanding of how ANNs and SNNs can be used to maximize their respective benefits.",

        "summary": "This paper proposes a convolutional neural network for bottom-up human pose estimation that involves two basic modules: a Global Relation Modeling module that learns the relation among regions of the image by fusing multiple stages features in the feature learning process, and a Multi-branch Feature Align module that aggregates features from multiple branches to align fused features and obtain refined local keypoint representation.",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we concern on the bottom-up paradigm in multi-person pose estimation (MPPE). Most previous bottom-up methods try to consider the relation of instances to identify different body parts during the post processing, while ignoring to model the relation among instances or environment in the feature learning process. In addition, most existing works adopt the operations of upsampling and downsampling. During the sampling process, there will be a problem of misalignment with the source features, resulting in deviations in the keypoint features learned by the model.   To overcome the above limitations, we propose a convolutional neural network for bottom-up human pose estimation. It invovles two basic modules: (i) Global Relation Modeling (GRM) module globally learns relation (e.g., environment context, instance interactive information) among region of image by fusing multiple stages features in the feature learning process. It combines with the spatial-channel attention mechanism, which focuses on achieving adaptability in spatial and channel dimensions. (ii) Multi-branch Feature Align (MFA) module aggregates features from multiple branches to align fused feature and obtain refined local keypoint representation. Our model has the ability to focus on different granularity from local to global regions, which significantly boosts the performance of the multi-person pose estimation. Our results on the COCO and CrowdPose datasets demonstrate that it is an efficient framework for multi-person pose estimation.",

        "summary": "Unsupervised domain adaptation is a challenging problem in 3D human pose estimation due to the large distribution gap between source and target domains. In this paper, we propose PoseDA, a simple yet effective framework of unsupervised domain adaptation for 3D human pose estimation. PoseDA combines global adaptation and local generalization to address the two major domain gaps: 1) the large distribution gap over global positions of poses between the source and target datasets due to variant camera parameters and settings, and 2) the deficient diversity of local structures of poses in training. Specifically, global adaptation aims to align global positions of poses from the source domain to the target domain with a proposed global position alignment (GPA) module. And local generalization is designed to enhance the diversity of 2D-3D pose mapping with a local pose augmentation (LPA) module. These modules bring significant performance improvement without introducing additional learnable parameters. In addition, we propose local pose augmentation (LPA) to enhance the diversity of 3D poses following an adversarial training scheme consisting of 1) a augmenta- tion generator that generates the parameters of pre-defined pose transformations and 2) an anchor discriminator to ensure the reality and quality of the augmented data. Our approach can be applicable to almost all 2D-3D lifting models. PoseDA achieves 61.3 mm of MPJPE on MPI-INF-3DHP under a cross-dataset evaluation setup, improving upon the previous state-of-the-art method by 10.2%.",

        "6_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "PoseDA is a framework for improving the performance of 3D human pose estimation models when they are applied to new datasets that are different from the one they were trained on. This is important because real-world data is often very different from the data that models are trained on, which can lead to poor performance. PoseDA addresses this problem by combining two techniques: global position alignment and local pose augmentation. Global position alignment ensures that the 3D poses generated by the model are aligned with the 2D poses in the new dataset, while local pose augmentation helps the model to learn a more diverse range of poses. This combination of techniques results in significant improvements in the performance of 3D human pose estimation models, and it is a promising approach for improving the accuracy of these models in real-world applications.",

One direction is to investigate the use of more sophisticated methods for global position alignment. The current approach uses a simple geometric constraint to align the 3D poses with the 2D poses, but more sophisticated methods could potentially improve the accuracy of the alignment. Another direction is to explore the use of different types of data augmentation for local pose augmentation. The current approach uses a simple adversarial training scheme to generate augmented poses, but other types of data augmentation could potentially improve the diversity of the augmented poses and the performance of the model. Finally, it would be interesting to explore the use of PoseDA for other tasks, such as 3D object detection and tracking.",

Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the original PoseFormer and other transformer-based variants on two benchmark datasets.",
        "abstract": "Recently, transformer-based methods have gained significant success in sequential 2D-to-3D lifting human pose estimation. As a pioneering work, PoseFormer captures spatial relations of human joints in each video frame and human dynamics across frames with cascaded transformer layers and has achieved impressive performance. However, in real scenarios, the performance of PoseFormer and its follow-ups is limited by two factors: (a) The length of the input joint sequence; (b) The quality of 2D joint detection. Existing methods typically apply self-attention to all frames of the input sequence, causing a huge computational burden when the frame number is increased to obtain advanced estimation accuracy, and they are not robust to noise naturally brought by the limited capability of 2D joint detectors. In this paper, we propose PoseFormerV2, which exploits a compact representation of lengthy skeleton sequences in the frequency domain to efficiently scale up the receptive field and boost robustness to noisy 2D joint detection. With minimum modifications to PoseFormer, the proposed method effectively fuses features both in the time domain and frequency domain, enjoying a better speed-accuracy trade-off than its precursor. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the original PoseFormer and other transformer-based variants.

Such methods ignore the fact that bodies are typically supported by the scene. A physics engine can be used to enforce physical plausibility, but these are not differentiable, rely on unrealistic proxy bodies, and are difficult to integrate into existing optimization and learning frameworks. In contrast, we exploit novel intuitive-physics (IP) terms that can be inferred from a 3D SMPL body interacting with the scene. Inspired by biomechanics, we infer the pressure heatmap on the body, the Center of Pressure (CoP) from the heatmap, and the SMPL body's Center of Mass (CoM). With these, we develop IPMAN, to estimate a 3D body from a color image in a \"stable\" configuration by encouraging plausible floor contact and overlapping CoP and CoM.

        "1_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "IPMAN-O uses a method called optimization to adjust the body's position and shape to match the image. It starts with a 3D body model that is not in the right position or shape. Then, it uses information from the image to adjust the model until it looks like the person in the image. IPMAN-R, on the other hand, uses a method called regression to directly predict the body's position and shape from the image. It does not use an initial 3D body model. IPMAN-O handles body-ground contact by using a term in its objective function that encourages the body to have stable contact with the ground. This term is based on the idea that a stable body will have its center of mass (CoM) close to its center of pressure (CoP), which is the point where the ground reaction force is applied. IPMAN-R, on the other hand, does not explicitly handle body-ground contact in its objective function. Instead, it relies on the data it is trained on to learn how to predict bodies that have stable contact with the ground.",

The goal of the algorithm is to refine this mesh such that it matches the input image. IPMAN-O can be seen as an extension of SMPLify-XMC [64]. Both methods optimize the camera pose and parameters, and the SMPL-X pose and shape. While SMPLify-XMC uses a local optimization, IPMAN-O employs our intuitive-physics terms as additional constraints. Like IPMAN-R, IPMAN-O uses the ground plane, but the ground contact is handled differently. IPMAN-R adds a ground contact loss to the regression objective, while IPMAN-O uses a term in the optimization objective. The latter approach gives more control over the parameters, and is particularly beneficial for optimization-based methods.",

Second, IPMAN's IP terms exploit inferred pressure heatmaps, the Center of Pressure (CoP), and the body's Center of Mass (CoM).

This means that the body should be able to stand or sit stably on the ground, and that it should not penetrate the ground or float in the air. IPMAN does this by inferring the pressure heatmap on the body, the Center of Pressure (CoP), and the body\u2019s Center of Mass (CoM). These are then used to develop novel IP terms that can be incorporated into existing optimization and regression methods to estimate a 3D body in a stable configuration.",

Intuitively, bodies with a CoM that is close to their CoP are more stable than ones with a CoP that is further away. IPMAN uses these IP terms in two ways. First, it incorporates them in an objective function that extends SMPLify-XMC to optimize for body poses that are stable. It also incorporates the same terms in the training loss for an HPS regressor, called IPMAN (Intuitive-Physics-based huMAN).",

The proposed method leverages the limited set of annotated keypoints and automatically generated segmentation masks of body parts to detect keypoints on the head, torso, hands, feet, arms, and legs, including also bent elbows and knees. Experiments on the jump-broadcast dataset and a second triple and long jump dataset prove that the proposed method is capable of detecting any desired keypoint on the body of athletes.",

In individual sports, these analyses mainly comprise the body posture. This paper focuses on the disciplines of triple, high, and long jump, which require fine-grained locations of the athlete's body. Typical human pose estimation datasets provide only a very limited set of keypoints, which is not sufficient in this case. Therefore, we propose a method to detect arbitrary keypoints on the whole body of the athlete by leveraging the limited set of annotated keypoints and auto-generated segmentation masks of body parts. Evaluations show that our model is capable of detecting keypoints on the head, torso, hands, feet, arms, and legs, including also bent elbows and knees. We analyze and compare different techniques to encode desired keypoints as the model's input and their embedding for the Transformer backbone.",

        "title": "Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation for Sports Broadcasts using Partial Sports Field Registration",
        "summary": "This paper presents a novel method for monocular 3D human pose estimation that is specifically designed for the large-scale collection of valid kinematic data from middle-distance running broadcasts. We demonstrate how injecting knowledge about the 3D geometry of a scene can improve the precision of 3D HPE. The process of recording sporting footage flattens information about the 3D world onto a 2D screen. Typical state-of-the-art approaches towards 3D HPE undo this projection by lifting detected 2D joint locations back into a third dimension (cf. Fig. 1(b)).\nIn this process, some information about the 3D setup of the current image is implied. Whether the monocular 3D HPE method uses a certain camera-model [24] or inter-frame consistency [11, 25], it has to somehow inflate information into a third dimension. The inductive bias from respective methods is learned over the statistics of the underlying training set. Most of the existing 3D HPE approaches are trained on datasets recorded in a laboratory setting with multiple static cameras, or in the wild with stereo-vision camera setups. In both of these approaches, the recorded subject is roughly within 6-20 meters of the camera. In the domain of sports broadcasting, the distances between the camera and the athletes are significantly larger and tele-zoom lenses with a narrow field-of-view are commonly used. It is to be expected, that off-the-shelf monocular 3D HPE methods will perform worse on these out-of-distribution images.",
        "abstract": "The filming of sporting events projects and flattens the movement of athletes in the world onto a 2D broadcast image. The pixel locations of joints in these images can be detected with high validity. Recovering the actual 3D movement of the limbs (kinematics) of the athletes requires lifting these 2D pixel locations back into a third dimension, implying a certain scene geometry. The well-known line markings of sports fields allow for the calibration of the camera and for determining the actual geometry of the scene. Close-up shots of athletes are required to extract detailed kinematics, which in turn obfuscates the pertinent field markers for camera calibration. We suggest partial sports field registration, which determines a set of scene-consistent camera calibrations up to a single degree of freedom. Through joint optimization of 3D pose estimation and camera calibration, we demonstrate the successful extraction of 3D running kinematics on a 400m track. In this work, we combine advances in 2D human pose estimation and camera calibration via partial sports field registration to demonstrate an avenue for collecting valid large-scale kinematic datasets. We generate a synthetic dataset of more than 10k images in Unreal Engine 5 with different viewpoints, running styles, and body types, to show the limitations of existing monocular 3D HPE methods.

In a dynamically created 3D scene, persons move randomly with simultaneously moving omnidirectional camera to generate synthetic RGB images and 2D and 3D ground truth. For evaluation purposes, the real-world PoseFES dataset with two scenarios and 701 frames with up to eight persons per scene was captured and annotated. We propose four training paradigms to finetune or re-train two top-down models in MMPose and two bottom-up models in CenterNet on THEODORE+. Beside a qualitative evaluation we report quantitative results. Compared to a COCO pretrained baseline, we achieve significant improvements especially for top-view scenes on the PoseFES dataset.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, there is a wide availability of datasets that enable the training of common object detectors or human detectors. These come in the form of labelled real-world images and require either a significant amount of human effort, with a high probability of errors such as missing labels, or very constrained scenarios, e.g. VICON systems. On the other hand, uncommon scenarios, like aerial views, animals, like wild zebras, or difficult-to-obtain information, such as human shapes, are hardly available. To overcome this, synthetic data generation with realistic rendering technologies has recently gained traction and advanced research areas such as target tracking and human pose estimation. However, subjects such as wild animals are still usually not well represented in such datasets. In this work, we first show that a pre-trained YOLO detector can not identify zebras in real images recorded from aerial viewpoints. To solve this, we present an approach for training an animal detector using only synthetic data. We start by generating a novel synthetic zebra dataset using GRADE, a state-of-the-art framework for data generation. The dataset includes RGB, depth, skeletal joint locations, pose, shape and instance segmentations for each subject. We use this to train a YOLO detector from scratch. Through extensive evaluations of our model with real-world data from i) limited datasets available on the internet and ii) a new one collected and manually labelled by us, we show that we can detect zebras by using only synthetic data during training.

We use GRADE to generate a dataset focused on indoor dynamic scenes with people and flying objects. Using this, we evaluate the performance of YOLO and Mask R-CNN on the tasks of segmenting and detecting people.

Recently, synthetic data generation and realistic rendering has advanced tasks like target tracking and human pose estimation. However, when focusing on vision applications, there is usually a lack of information like sensor measurements or time continuity. On the other hand, simulations for most robotics tasks are performed in (semi)static environments, with specific sensors and low visual fidelity. To solve this, we introduced in our previous work a fully customizable framework for generating realistic animated dynamic environments (GRADE) [1].

        "summary": "This paper introduces a higher-order regular splitting graph network (RS-Net) for 2D-to-3D human pose estimation using matrix splitting in conjunction with weight and adjacency modulation. The core idea is to capture long-range dependencies between body joints using multi-hop neighborhoods and also to learn different modulation vectors for different body joints as well as a modulation matrix added to the adjacency matrix associated to the skeleton.",
        "abstract": "In human pose estimation methods based on graph convolutional architectures, the human skeleton is usually modeled as an undirected graph whose nodes are body joints and edges are connections between neighboring joints. However, most of these methods tend to focus on learning relationships between body joints of the skeleton using first-order neighbors, ignoring higher-order neighbors and hence limiting their ability to exploit relationships between distant joints. In this paper, we introduce a higher-order regular splitting graph network (RS-Net) for 2D-to-3D human pose estimation using matrix splitting in conjunction with weight and adjacency modulation. The core idea is to capture long-range dependencies between body joints using multi-hop neighborhoods and also to learn different modulation vectors for different body joints as well as a modulation matrix added to the adjacency matrix associated to the skeleton. This learnable modulation matrix helps adjust the graph structure by adding extra graph edges in an effort to learn additional connections between body joints. Instead of using a shared weight matrix for all neighboring body joints, the proposed RS-Net model applies weight unsharing before aggregating the feature vectors associated to the joints in order to capture the different relations between them. Experiments and ablations studies performed on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving superior performance over recent state-of-the-art methods for 3D human pose estimation.",

The skeleton-based approach is more accurate and reliable than the silhouette-based approach because it is not affected by changes in clothing or lighting conditions.",
        "1_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The skeleton-based approach to gait identification offers several key advantages over the traditional silhouette-based approach. Firstly, the skeleton-based approach is more robust to changes in clothing and lighting conditions. This is because the skeleton-based approach relies on the geometry of the human body, which is not affected by these factors. In contrast, the silhouette-based approach is sensitive to changes in clothing and lighting conditions, as these factors can alter the shape of the silhouette. Secondly, the skeleton-based approach is more accurate than the silhouette-based approach. This is because the skeleton-based approach provides more information about the human body than the silhouette-based approach. The skeleton-based approach provides information about the position of the joints and the length of the bones, while the silhouette-based approach only provides information about the shape of the body. Finally, the skeleton-based approach is more efficient than the silhouette-based approach. This is because the skeleton-based approach can be computed more quickly than the silhouette-based approach.",

EViTPose utilizes three patch selection methods: two guided by a lightweight pose estimator and one based on learnable joint tokens. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that EViTPose significantly reduces GFLOPs (30-44%) with a minimal drop in accuracy (0-3.5%).",
        "abstract": "While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely successful in 2D human pose estimation, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a promising alternative to CNNs, boosting state-of-the-art performance. However, the quadratic computational complexity of ViTs has limited their applicability for processing high-resolution images. In this paper, we propose three methods for reducing ViT's computational complexity, which are based on selecting and processing a small number of most informative patches while disregarding others. The first two methods leverage a lightweight pose estimation network to guide the patch selection process, while the third method utilizes a set of learnable joint tokens to ensure that the selected patches contain the most important information about body joints. Experiments across six benchmarks show that our proposed methods achieve a significant reduction in computational complexity, ranging from 30% to 44%, with only a minimal drop in accuracy between 0% and 3.5%.",

        "abstract": "Pose and motion priors are crucial for recovering realistic and accurate human motion from noisy observations. Substantial progress has been made on pose and shape estimation from images, and recent works showed impressive results using priors to refine frame-wise predictions. However, a lot of motion priors only model transitions between consecutive poses and are used in time-consuming optimization procedures, which is problematic for many applications requiring real-time motion capture. We introduce Motion-DVAE, a motion prior to capture the short-term dependencies of human motion. As part of the dynamical variational autoencoder (DVAE) models family, Motion-DVAE combines the generative capability of VAE models and the temporal modeling of recurrent architectures. Together with Motion-DVAE, we introduce an unsupervised learned denoising method unifying regression- and optimization-based approaches in a single framework for real-time 3D human pose estimation.

Existing pose estimation pipelines are often ill-posed in such scenes. To overcome this, we propose a novel framework called Bottom-Up Conditioned Top-Down (BUCTD) pose estimation. BUCTD uses the output of a bottom-up pose estimator as a pose proposal to condition a top-down pose estimator. This allows BUCTD to address the ambiguity problem of top-down approaches in crowds.

        "abstract": "Frequent interactions between individuals are a fundamental challenge for pose estimation algorithms. Current pipelines either use an object detector together with a pose estimator (top-down approach), or localize all body parts first and then link them to predict the pose of individuals (bottom-up). Yet, when individuals closely interact, top-down methods are ill-defined due to overlapping individuals, and bottom-up methods often falsely infer connections to distant bodyparts. Thus, we propose a novel pipeline called bottom-up conditioned top-down pose estimation (BUCTD) that combines the strengths of bottom-up and top-down methods. Specifically, we propose to use a bottom-up model as the detector, which in addition to an estimated bounding box provides a pose proposal that is fed as condition to an attention-based top-down model. We demonstrate the performance and efficiency of our approach on animal and human pose estimation benchmarks. On CrowdPose and OCHuman, we outperform previous state-of-the-art models by a significant margin.

EvoPose consists of three modules: a Structural Priors Representation (SPR) module, a SpatioTemporal Enhancement (STE) module, and a Recursive Refinement (RR) module. The SPR module extracts structural features from the kinematic tree, representing human body priors. The STE module combines the extracted structural features with a 2D pose sequence to capture spatiotemporal patterns and inject kinematic constraints. The RR module refines the estimated 3D poses recursively, further incorporating human priors. Experiments demonstrate that EvoPose achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular benchmarks, Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.",
        "abstract": "Transformer is popular in recent 3D human pose estimation, which utilizes long-term modeling to lift 2D keypoints into the 3D space. However, current transformer-based methods do not fully exploit the prior knowledge of the human skeleton provided by the kinematic structure. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based model EvoPose to introduce the human body prior knowledge for 3D human pose estimation effectively. Specifically, a Structural Priors Representation (SPR) module represents human priors as structural features carrying rich body patterns, e.g. joint relationships. The structural features are interacted with 2D pose sequences and help the model to achieve more informative spatiotemporal features. Moreover, a Recursive Refinement (RR) module is applied to refine the 3D pose outputs by utilizing estimated results and further injects human priors simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoPose which achieves a new state of the art on two most popular benchmarks, Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.",

Once the network has been pruned, it is then fine-tuned on a dataset of synthetic images. These images are generated by back-propagating gradients to noise images, which means that the network learns to reconstruct the original images from the noise.

Another effective strategy is to formulate the problem as a joint multi-object pose estimation task. By attempting to separate the goalie, stick, and net while jointly estimating their poses, this approach can incorporate specific constraints in their joint spatial relationships, such as the goalie's position in front of the net and the stick being held in their hand.

        "6_question": "What kind of dataset is used to train GoalieNet?",
        "6_answers:eli5": "GoalieNet is trained on a special dataset of ice hockey videos. These videos have been carefully annotated with the positions of the goalie, their gear, and the net.",
        "6_answers:expert": "GoalieNet is trained on a dataset comprising 32 NHL video clips, with 5,032 frames containing a goalie. The keypoints being detected include 22 keypoints related to the goalie, four keypoints for the net, and three keypoints for the stick.",
        "6_additional_depth_q:follow up question": "Why is it difficult for the network to detect the upper part of the stick?",
        "6_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "The upper part of the stick is thin and moves fast, making it difficult for the network to see it clearly and accurately.",
        "6_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "The low detection accuracy of the upper part of the stick can be attributed to its narrow shape and rapid movement, as it is constantly held and manipulated by the goalie during play. This makes it challenging for the network to effectively capture the stick's pose and distinguish it from other objects in the scene.",
        "6_additional_breath_q:follow up question": "How are the joint keypoints detected and estimated by GoalieNet?",
        "6_additional_breath_q:answers:eli5": "GoalieNet uses a type of deep learning called a \"multi-stage network\" to figure out where the goalie, their equipment, and the net are in an image or video. It looks at each part separately (like a goalie's shoulder or the top of the net) and then puts all the information together to make a guess about where everything is. The network is trained on lots of videos of goalies, so it learns to recognize the different parts and how they move.",
        "6_additional_breath_q:answers:expert": "GoalieNet detects and estimates joint keypoints through a multi-stage architecture inspired by [2]. The network leverages cross-stage aggregation between adjacent stages and employs different kernel sizes at various levels to enhance localization accuracy. The training process involves optimizing the network to jointly estimate all 29 keypoints across the goalie, equipment, and net in a single step. By incorporating an extended bounding box to encompass all these objects and generating 29 heatmaps, one for each keypoint, GoalieNet predicts keypoint coordinates based on the positions of the first and second maximum values within each heatmap.",
        "7_question": "How is GoalieNet evaluated?",
        "7_answers:eli5": "GoalieNet is evaluated by comparing its predictions to the actual positions of the goalie, their gear, and the net. The closer the predictions are to the actual positions, the more accurate GoalieNet is.",
        "7_answers:expert": "GoalieNet is evaluated using the Euclidean distance between the predicted and actual keypoint positions, divided by the bounding box diameter. A keypoint is considered detected if this distance is less than 0.05.",
        "7_additional_depth_q:follow up question": "How does GoalieNet measure the accuracy of its keypoint predictions?",
        "7_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "GoalieNet measures the accuracy of its keypoint predictions by comparing the predicted keypoint locations to the actual keypoint locations in the training data. If the predicted keypoint location is within a certain distance of the actual keypoint location, then the prediction is considered to be correct.",
        "7_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "GoalieNet measures the accuracy of its keypoint predictions using the Euclidean distance between the predicted and actual keypoint positions, divided by the bounding box diameter. A keypoint is considered detected if this distance is less than 0.05.",

        "8_question": "What are the challenges in goalie pose estimation?",
        "8_answers:eli5": "Goalie pose estimation is tricky because goalies wear a lot of padding and gear, which can make it hard to see their joints. Also, goalies move very quickly and often in unexpected ways, which can make it hard to track them.",
        "8_answers:expert": "Goalie pose estimation is challenging due to the special shape and equipment used by goalies, which differ from typical human pose estimation tasks. The presence of non-human keypoints corresponding to the net and the need to track the net's movement further complicate the problem.",
        "8_additional_depth_q:follow up question": "How does the occlusion of certain body parts make the task of goalie pose estimation more challenging?",
        "8_additional_depth_q:answers:eli5": "When the goalie's body parts are covered by equipment or other objects, such as the stick or net, it makes it more difficult for the computer to accurately determine the pose of those body parts. This is because the computer relies on visual cues to identify the keypoints corresponding to different body parts, and when these cues are obscured, it can lead to incorrect pose estimation.",
        "8_additional_depth_q:answers:expert": "Occlusion in goalie pose estimation poses a significant challenge due to the presence of protective equipment and the net. The bulky padding, helmet, and gloves can obstruct the visibility of underlying body parts, making it difficult for computer vision algorithms to accurately detect and locate keypoints. The net, which is a large and often dynamic object, can also block the view of the goalie's body, further complicating the pose estimation process.",
        "8_additional_breath_q:follow up question": "What key challenges are involved in goalie pose estimation?",
        "8_additional_breath_q:answers:eli5": "Goalie pose estimation faces challenges because of the unique gear used by goalies, which differs from typical human pose estimation tasks. There is also the need to track the position of the net, which adds complexity to the estimation process. These factors make the task more challenging than the usual human pose estimation techniques.",
        "8_additional_breath_q:answers:expert": "Goalie pose estimation poses unique challenges due to the unusual equipment worn by goalies, including leg pads, masks, and gloves. This differs from the typical human pose estimation tasks, where the focus is on detecting keypoints corresponding to human joints. Another challenge is the presence of non-human keypoints, such as those corresponding to the hockey net. The goalie's pose estimation requires tracking the movement of the net, adding another layer of complexity to the task.",
